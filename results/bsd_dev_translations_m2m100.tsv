今日は調査の進め方についてトレーニングします。	I will be teaching you how to conduct research today.	Today we will train on how the investigation is going forward.
オンライン調査みたいなものですか？	Like just searching online?	Is it like an online survey?
それも含みます。	Yes and no.	It also includes.
まず、出所が正規のところであるかどうか確認しないといけません。	First of all we need to make sure the sources are legitimate.	First of all, you need to check if the source is correct.
ブログとかコラムなどはだめということですか？	So no blogs or editorial?	Do you want to blog or column?
そのとおり。	Exactly.	as well.
最初に見るところは政府のホームページです。	The first place I would look at is government websites.	The first thing to see is the government’s website.
政府の数字は、一般的に正確で信用性が高いものです。	They typically have accurate data that is trustworthy.	Government figures are generally accurate and reliable.
他に良いサイトは？	What other websites would be good?	What other good site?
大手の銀行、会計事務所、市場調査会社などの企業データも活用できます。	You can also check out major institutions like banks, accounting companies, and market research companies.	You can also use corporate data such as major banks, accounting offices, and market research companies.
どうしてですか？	Why those?	Why is it?
こうした企業は有名で、たいてい質の良い市況報告を発行しています。	They are well known and typically publishes good market reports.	These companies are well-known and mostly publish good quality market status reports.
でも、市況報告は無料でないこともあります。	But some market reports aren't free.	However, market reporting is not free.
なので、無料データで探します。	So stick to the ones that are free.	So we’re looking for it for free data.
でも、もし、有料データで良さそうなのがあったら？	What if it seems the report is useful?	But what if there was a good deal with the data?
私に相談してください。	You can consult with me then.	Please consult me.
でも、君がやるのはほとんど予備調査だよ。	But a lot of the research you will be doing is preliminary research.	But what you do is almost a preliminary investigation.
経営陣に見せるような調査ではありません。	So it won't be presented to upper management.	It is not an investigation to the management.
わかりました。	I see.	I realized.
市況報告書を購入するようなケースはあるのですか？	Would there be cases when we would purchase market reports?	Is there any case to buy a market report?
詳しい実現可能性調査をするようなときには購入が必要になります。	We will need them when we conduct detailed feasibility studies.	You will need to make a comprehensive analysis of the possibility of purchase.
そういう調査は上層部へ報告されるので、専門の第３者企業に認証された情報でなければなりません。	These will be presented to the upper management so we need to show that the information is validated by professional third-party companies.	Such research is to the top department, so it must be information certified by a professional third-party company.
わかりました。	Got it.	I realized.
ベンさん、こんにちは、またお会いできて嬉しいです。	Hi Ben, it's nice to see you again.	Hello Ben, I am glad to see you again.
こちらこそお会いできて嬉しいです。	Nice to see you as well.	I am glad to see you here.
ビジネスの方はいかがですか。	Business has been good?	What about the business?
休暇のシーズンでちょっと活気がないですが、それが普通です。	It's been a bit slow with the holiday season but that's normal.	It’s not a little busy during the holiday season, but that’s normal.
今日はお越しいただいてありがとうございます。	Again thank you for coming in today.	Thank you for being here today.
先週送って頂いた提案についてお話したかったんです。	I wanted to discuss the proposal you sent me last week.	I wanted to tell you about the proposals you sent last week.
はい、マーケットリサーチに関する件ですね。	Yes, the one regarding the market research.	Yes, it’s about market research.
社内で内容を検討したのですが、ちょっと我々が求めていたものとは違っていた感じがあります。	I reviewed the contents internally and felt that it wasn't quite something we were looking for.	I thought about the content within the company, but it was a little different from what we wanted.
もう少し具体的にお話して頂けますか。	Can you be a bit more specific?	Can you tell me a bit more specifically?
リサーチがもっと多くのトピックを掘り下げるのを期待していました。	We were hoping that the research will cover more topics in depths.	I was expecting the research to hide more topics.
しかしおおむねすでに私たちが知っている情報をカバーしていました。	But it basically covers information we already know.	But above all, we covered the information we already know.
会社への聞き取り調査など、もっと実地調査を期待されていましたか？	Were you expecting more field work like interviewing companies?	Did you expect more research to the company?
はい、そうです。	That's correct.	Yes Yes Yes.
その場合、私共のサービスの料金体制が変わってきます。	If that's the case, the cost structure for our service would be different.	In this case, the tax system for our services will change.
それでは一律料金ではなくなるということですか？	So it won't be a flat price?	Does it mean that they are not all paid?
組み合わせになりますね。	It will be a combination.	It will be combined.
ですから基本料金の上に、実地調査を行う期間中に月々の依頼料がかかります。	So there will be the base price plus a monthly retainer fee for the duration of the field work.	Therefore, on the basis of the fee, you will pay a monthly fee during the period of real-world investigation.
また、旅費と毎日の食費もかかります。	Also, travel expense and a daily meal allowance would have to be covered as well.	It also costs travel and daily food.
そうですか。	I see.	Yes is?
上司と話し合うので、その料金体制で別の提案を出して頂けますか？	How about you give me another proposal with that cost structure so I can discuss it with my boss.	Do you talk to your boss, and can you make a different proposal in the tax system?
はい、すぐにご用意できます。	Yeah I can whip that up quickly.	Yes, I can prepare you immediately.
週末までに改訂した提案をお渡しします。	I think I can get you a revised proposal by the end of the week.	We will submit an amended proposal by the end of the week.
大変ありがたいです。	That would be great.	I am very grateful.
できるだけ早く送ってください。	Please send it to us as soon as you can.	Please send it as soon as possible.
そうします。	Will do.	I do it.

来年御社の販売量が拡大するかどうかお聞きしたかったんです。	I just wanted to ask if your sales volume will be increasing in the next year.	I would like to ask if the company’s sales will increase next year.

割引料金にしてもらえますかね？	Do you think we can get a discounted rate?	Can you get a discount fee?
そう思いますよ。	I think so.	I think so.
御社はこれまで一度も保険請求をなさっていません。	You guys haven't had any insurance claims since you started.	The company has never claimed insurance.
つまりローリスクとみなされるんですよ。	So you guys would be deemed low risk.	This means that you are considered to be a risk.
割引料金をご提供できると思います。	I think I can get you guys a lower rate.	I can offer you a discount fee.
それは素晴らしい。	That would be great.	It is great.

それが、来週なんだよ。	It's happening next week.	That is the next week.
今年既に君が作ってくれたプレゼンを見直していたんだが、書き換えが必要なところがあるんだ。	I was reviewing the presentation you made for me earlier this year and realized that it needs to be updated.	I've already reviewed the presentations you've made this year, but there's something you need to replace.
それなら、もちろんできますよ。	Sure I can do that.	So you can, of course.
会社プレゼンの新しいバージョンが総務部から出ているか調べてくれるかい？	Can you check if there's a new version of the company presentation from the administration department?	Can you check if the new version of the company’s presentation is out of the headquarters?

我らの世代は、出世のために仕事に時間も労力も費やしてきただろう。	Our generation is willing to invest our time and effort in order to build our careers.	Our generation will have spent time and effort on work for birth.
一般的に我々は自分自身の仕事、会社の為に献身的なんだ。	We were generally committed to our jobs and the companies we work for.	We are generally dedicated to our own work, our company.
そうだよ、私は25年間ずっとそうやってきた。	Yep, that's what I have been doing for the last 25 years.	Yes, I have been doing so for 25 years.
でもミレニアルは我々ほど献身的ではなさそうだね。	But the millennials don't seem as committed as we are.	But Millennium is not as dedicated as us.
数年経つと、新しい機会を見つけて去っていく傾向にあるんだ。	They tend to leave for new opportunities after a few years.	After a few years, they tend to find a new opportunity.
何を優先させるかというのも違うよね？	Their priorities are different too, right?	It doesn’t matter what you prioritize, right?
彼らは長い目で見て、自分に有利になる様な事を求めているようだ。	It seems that they wanted something that benefit them in the long run.	They look at it in the long run and look for something that will benefit them.
ミレニアルは不景気や職の不安定さを経験しているから、どんな事でも同じ状況が続くとは期待していないんだよ。	With the bad economy and the job insecurities the millennials have experienced, they don't expect things to stay the same.	Millennials are experiencing crisis and job instability, so they do not expect that the same situation will continue in any way.
彼らが頻繁に職を変えるのはそれが理由かい？	Is that the reason they tend to switch jobs more frequently?	That’s why they’re changing jobs often.
多分ね、でも私の勘違いかもしれないけど。	Maybe, but I could be mistaken.	Maybe, but it may be my mistake.
今年うちに雇われた従業員は真面目そうだけどね。	The ones we hired this year seem pretty decent though.	Employees employed this year are serious.
そうだね。	I agree with you.	Yes is.
彼らが違う世代なんだという事を受け入れないといけないんだよ。	I need to accept the fact that they are totally different generation.	You have to accept that they are different generations.
そして少し大目に見てあげないと。	And I need to cut them some slack.	I have to look at him a little bigger.
マリッサとケイラブの働きぶりを見たけど、彼らはとても真面目だよ。	I have supervised Marissa and Caleb, and they work really hard.	I have seen Marissa and the work of Cairo, but they are very serious.
ただ数年後には彼らも我々の元を去ってしまうのか心配だけど。	I am just afraid they will leave us in a few years.	I am worried that in a few years they will leave us.
それは私も心配だね。	That's my fear too.	I am worried about that too.
彼らは失うには勿体ない人材だよ。	They are too good to let go.	They are not good people to lose.
それは、もう一つ考えなければいけない事だね。	That's another thing to consider.	That is something else you have to think about.
どうにかして従業員の離職率を低めて、定着率を上げる方法を見つけないといけないな。	We have to figure out ways to reduce turnover and increase employee retention.	Somehow you need to find a way to lower the employment rate and increase the fixation rate.
私にいけてる上司になれという意味かい？	Does that mean I have to be the coolest boss to make them like me?	What does it mean to be a boss?
ならなくてもいいけど、なるとプラスにはなるね。	You don't have to, but it probably will help.	You can’t do it, but it’s going to be a plus.
でも君は君のままでいいよ。	But you just have to be you.	But you may remain yours.
もうすでに君は若い従業員にとって素晴らしい見本だよ。	You are a great role model for them already.	You are already a great example for young employees.
有難う。	Thank you for saying that.	and thank you.
じゃあ今からまた最高の上司になって若い子たちの手助けをしてくるよ。	Now let me get back to being an awesome boss and help those young people.	Now again, I will be the greatest boss to help the young people.
話せて良かったよ。	It was nice chatting with you.	I was happy to talk.
コピー用紙がもうすぐなくなりそうだけど。	We're almost running out of copy paper.	Copy paper will soon disappear.
そうですか、気づいていませんでした。	Oh, I didn't notice.	Yes, I didn’t realize.
今すぐ注文しておきますね。	I'll order now.	I will order it right now.
今週中に届くかな。	Do you think they'll come this week?	It will arrive during this week.
週末までにたくさん印刷するものがあるんだよ。	I need to print out lots of things by weekend.	There are a lot of things to print until the weekend.
いつも注文した翌日に届くので、大丈夫でしょう。	They usually deliver the next day, so it should be fine.	It will always come the next day you order, so it’s okay.
でも、念のために、注文の際に確認しておきますね。	But I'll double check when I order, just in case.	But I will check it when you order.
よろしく頼む。	Appreciate it.	Welcome to please.
ついでに、大きめの封筒も少し頼んでくれるかな。	Can you also order large envelopes together?	I would like to ask you for a little big cover.
分かりました。	Sure.	I understood.
他には何かいりますか？	Anything else?	Do you want something else?
いや、それだけだ。	No, that's it.	No, that’s all.
じゃ、頼んでおきますね。	Ok, it will be done soon.	So I will ask you.
ありがとう。	Thanks.	thank you.
すみません、森さん、ちょっといいですか？	Excuse me, Mori-san, can I ask you something?	Sorry, Forest, is it a good thing?
はい、何でしょう。	Yes, how can I help?	Yes, what is it.
客先に出すこのメール文、これでいいでしょうか？	Could you check my e-mail letter to the client?	You can send this email to the customer, is this?
えーと、ここ、語順をこういうふうに入れ替えた方がいいと思いますけど。	Hmm, here, I think you should change the word order, like this.	I think it is better to replace the word in this way.
えっ、今のすごい早いですね。	Wow, it’s so quick.	Well, it’s very fast right now.
コピペショートカットキーを使ったのよ。	I used copy-and-paste short cut keys.	I used a short cutting key.
コントロールキーとCでコピーして、コントロールとVでペーストするんです。	You can press control key and C to copy, and then paste it with control and V keys.	Copy with Control Key and C and paste with Control and V.
へー、ショートカットキーは便利ですね。	Ah, short cuts are useful, aren’t they?	The short cutting key is helpful.
森さんは、パソコンでメール打つのも早いですよね。	You type e-mails so fast on the PC, don’t you?	It’s easy to send emails on your computer, right?
僕は携帯メールは早く打てるんですけどね。	I can send text messages on my mobile very fast.	I’m getting my mobile emails quickly.
中村さんたちはスマホ世代だから、フリック入力は早いのよね。	You are in the smartphone generation, so you use flick input skilfully.	We are a cell phone generation, so it’s quick to enter.
私は、携帯だと画面の文字が小さくてメガネなしには良く見えないし。	I can’t see small letters on my mobile screen without reading glasses.	I think the screen is small and I can’t look good without glasses.
スマホなら画面拡大できますよ。	But you can zoom in on the letters on a smartphone.	The phone can expand the screen.
うーん、それでも、なんか使いにくい。	I know, even so, I can’t see the whole picture.	Yes, yet it’s hard to use.
キーは２つ一緒に打っちゃうし、パソコンの方が楽だわ。	And my finger catches two keys at the same time, so I prefer to type on PC.	There are two keys together, and the computer is easier.
僕のうちにはもう、ラップトップはないですよ。	We no longer use laptops in my family.	I no longer have a laptop.
ふーん。	Hmm.	and the.
みなさん、おはようございます。	Good morning, everyone.	My friends, good morning.
会議を始めますよ。	Could I have your attention, please?	We will start the meeting.
ご出席ありがとうございます。	Thank you all for coming.	Thank you for your presence.
さあ本題に入りましょう。	Let's get down to business.	Let’s go into the topic.
このミーティングは社内での紙の消費量を減らすことについて話し合うのが目的です。	The goal of this meeting is to talk about reducing paper consumption in our office.	The meeting aims to discuss how to reduce paper consumption within the company.
アレックス、この件について意見はありますか？	Alex, what's your opinion on this?	Alex, do you have any opinions about this?
素晴らしいアイディアだと思います。	I think it's a great idea.	I think it is a great idea.
我が社は昨年コピー用紙の購入に10,000ドル以上費やしました。	We spent more than 10,000 dollars on purchasing printer paper last year.	Our company spent more than $10,000 on the purchase of copies paper last year.
インクカートリッジやペーパークリップ、フォルダーを含まずにこの金額です。	That doesn't even include printer ink, paper clips, and folders.	This amount does not include ink, paper clips, and folder.
ペーパーレス化を進めることで多額のお金を節約できるでしょう。	We would save huge sums of money by going paperless.	You will be able to save a lot of money by developing paperless.
それに書類の保管に場所を取られすぎていますし。	We also dedicate too much storage space to paperwork.	There is too much space to store the documents.
そうですね、私もそう思っていました。	Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.	Yes, I thought that too.
フランシスコ、他にこの件について意見はありますか？	Francisco, do you have any other thoughts on this?	Francis, do you have any other opinions about this?
まだ言及されていない利点があるとすれば環境にも優しい点です。	One advantage we haven't talked about is the environmental benefits.	If there are benefits that are not mentioned yet, they are environmentally friendly.
私たちが書類をデジタル式で保存するようになればゴミも少なくなるでしょう。	We'll produce less waste if we start saving our paperwork digitally.	If we keep the documents in digital form, there will be less waste.
それも私が取り組みたいと思っていたことです。	That's also something I wanted to work on.	That is also what I wanted to do.
アダム、あなたはどう思いますか？	What do you think, Adam?	Adam, what do you think?
紙の使用を直ちに完全に止めるのは多分難しいでしょう。	It will probably be hard to go completely paper free at once.	It may be difficult to stop the use of paper completely immediately.
少しずつ進めるしかないでしょうね。	I think we'll probably have to take baby steps.	You just have to move a little by a little.
部によって書類作成へのニーズがまちまちなので、それぞれの部が部内の紙の使用量を管理すべきでしょう。	Each division should manage their paper usage since they all have different needs for documentation.	Because the needs for document creation are different by the department, each department should control the use of paper within the department.
新たに発生する書類をみんながデジタル式で保存することが第一歩かもしれません。	We could probably start by having everyone save new paperwork digitally.	It can be the first step for everyone to save new documents in digital form.
その後、だれかが過去の書類もデジタル式コピーに変換すればいいのです。	Then, someone could convert the old paperwork into digital copies.	After that, someone should convert the past documents into a digital copy.
最初のうちは苦労すると思いますが、ファイルの中で書類が行方不明になるのも防げるかもしれませんし。	I think it would take a lot of work in the beginning, but it might help prevent papers getting misplaced in files.	In the beginning, it may be difficult, but it may also prevent the documents from disappearing in the file.
なるほど。	That seems like a good idea.	So much.
どんな選択肢があるか技術チームに掛け合ってみましょう。	I'll meet with the tech team to see what our options are.	Let us know what the technical team has to do.
いろいろなソフトウェアを比べてどれが最適か評価しないといけないですからね。	We'll need to evaluate different softwares to see which will work best.	You need to evaluate which software is the best in comparison.
それから実装やトレーニングにかかるコストを算出できますね。	Then we can calculate how much the implementation and training will cost.	You can then calculate the cost of implementation and training.
次のミーティングでは詳細をさらに議論できると思います。	I think we can discuss these details further next meeting.	In the next meeting we will be able to discuss more details.
話を進めて技術チームから複数のソフトウェア案を見せてくれる方にお越しいただきましょう。	I'll go ahead and bring in someone from the tech team to show you the different software options.	Let us talk to you and show you a number of software suggestions from the technical team.
みなさん、お疲れ様でした！	Great meeting, team!	Congratulations all of you!
由衣さん、久しぶり！	Yui, it's been a long time!	Dress for a long time!
あ、キースさん、本当久しぶり！	Hi, Keith, yeah, it's been ages!	Oh, Kiss, I’ve been seeing you for a long time!
そうそう、例の大型プロジェクト、由衣さんの案が採用だって？	Oh, by the way I heard your proposal got approved for that large-scale project.	Yes, is it a big project, the project of Mr. Dress?
わあ、もう聞いてます？	Wow, you've heard about that all ready?	Are you listening to it already?
うん、この間ブラウン課長が話してたよ。	Yes, Mr. Brown was talking about that the other day.	Yes, Mr. Brown talked about it recently.
おめでとう。	Congratulations!	Congratulations to.
ありがとう。	Why thank you.	thank you.
あの鬼のブラウン課長に認めて貰えるのはすごいと思うよ。	It's amazing that you got recognized from Mr. Brown, the section chief with a heart of stone.	I think it’s great to be able to recognize that braun boss.
しー、それ聞こえたら大変。	Shhh, what if he catches you calling him that.	It’s hard to hear it.
キースさんって、前ブラウン課長のプロジェクトチームに居たんだっけ。	Oh right, Keith, you were in his project team before.	Mr. Keys was in the project team of the former Brown Director.
うん、なんか怖そうに見えるかもしれないけど、出来る人だよ。	Yup, he might look somewhat intimidating, but he's an able person.	You may seem scared, but you can.
それもあって、ちょっとプレッシャー感じてるんだ。	That's one of the reasons I feel a bit nervous.	I also feel a bit of pressure.
ああ、かなり大きい案件だしね。	Well, I guess, it's a pretty big project, too.	Oh, that’s a pretty big case.
来週までに人員計画出して、人事にも確認取らなきゃで、あー、もう既に忙しくて。	I have to draft a staffing plan by next week, get approval from HR, aghh, I already have a lot to do.	You have to plan the staff for the next week, and you have to check the staff for the next week, you’re already busy.
由衣さん、落ち着いて。	Relax, Yui.	Clothes, be calm.
あのね、それ事前に人事の安田さんに話し通しとくと全然楽だから。	Look, it'll get much easier if you run it by Ms. Yasuda in HR beforehand.	I think it’s easy to talk to Anita before that.
あと、ブラウン課長のとこは残業気をつけてね。	But you should be careful if you do overtime when you work under Mr. Brown.	At the same time, Mr. Brown’s head of state is careful.
ありがと、頑張ってみる。	Thanks, I'll try my best.	Thank you, I will try hard.
ああ、ここでのんびりコーヒー飲んでる場合じゃないかも。	Well, I guess I shouldn't even be here having coffee.	Maybe you’re going to be drinking coffee here.
こら、おしゃべりな同僚と気分切り替えるのも必要でしょ？	Hey, you should also refresh yourself with a chatty coworker, right?	You need to change feelings with your friends, right?
そうだ、ひと休みするって事で、金曜日はかなり忙しい？	Oh yeah, speaking of taking a break, are you super busy on Friday?	Do you want to go on a vacation, Friday is busy?
えっと、１９日だよね？	let's see, you mean the 19th?	It is 19 days, right?
んーどうかな、明日どれくらい進むかによるけど。	Well, I really can't tell, depends on how far along I get tomorrow.	It depends on how long it will go tomorrow.
なんで？	What about it?	Why to?
早めに上がれそうなら、お祝いに俺が奢るっての、どう？	If you can get off early, how about I buy you a drink and toast to your success.	If I get up early, what if I want to celebrate?
やった、ゴチになります！	Yay, I like that idea!	I have done it, it will be crazy!
あの角のバルとか、安いとこでよければだけど。	If you don't mind going to a cheapie place like that Spanish bar at the corner, though.	If you want a bar or a cheap bar.
全然いい、気合い入れて定時に終わらせる。	Doesn't matter at all, I'll push myself to get the work done on time.	It’s good, I’m happy to finish it in time.
仕事終わりにラインすればいい？	Should I LINE you when I'm done?	Do I have a line at the end of work?
俺、ラインあんまり見ないから、携帯メールの方がいいかな。	I don't check my LINE very often so I think a text message to my mobile is better.	I don’t look at the line, so I’m better using a cell phone.
あの既読とか付いて返信しなきゃいけない気がするの、苦手なんだよね。	I don't really like that massages get marked as read, and these makes you feel like you have to reply right away.	I don’t feel like you have to read and answer it, right?
あ、ブラウン課長はいつもラインで、スタンプも送ってくるよ。	Oh, Mr. Brown always uses LINE and he sends messages with stickers, too.	Oh, the chief Brown is always on the line and sends the stamps.
まじで！？	No way!!	seriously?
まじまじ、結構お茶目なとこあるよ。	Seriously, he does silly things sometimes.	Seriously, there’s a lot of tea.
そうだ、ブラウン課長も誘ってみない？	Yeah, why don't we ask Mr. Brown to join us?	Would you like to invite Mr. Brown?
うわー、それはちょっとまだハードル高いかも。	Oh no, that is too much of a challenge for me right now.	Maybe it’s a bit too hard.
打ち解ければ結構いい人だし、今後仕事もしやすいと思うけど。	He's quite a nice guy once you get to know him and I think it'll help you when you work together.	I think he’s a good man, and I think it’s easy to work.
うーん、ちょっと考えさせて。	Well, let me think about that.	Oh yeah, let me think a little.
とにかく無理そうなら早めに連絡ちょうだい。	Anyway, if you can't make it, can you text me ASAP?	If you can, please contact us early.
了解。	You got it.	to understand.

社のウェブサイトを立ち上げてはどうかと思うのですが、どう思いますか？	I'm thinking of setting up a website for the company but what do you think?	I want to start the company’s website, what do you think?
近々作らなければとは思っていたんだけど、あまり詳しい者もいないようだし、後回しになっていた議題だね。	I was just thinking that we should make one soon, but we don't have anyone that knows a lot about it and is something that we've been pushing back.	I thought I had to do it soon, but it seems that there are not so many people who know it, and that's what I've been talking about later.
この辺は田舎だしお年寄りも多いから、まだまだ紙媒体の広告に頼りがちだけど、そろそろ作った方が良さそうだ。	This area is rural and there are a lot of seniors so we still tend to rely on print advertisement but I think it is about time we made one.	This area is rural and there are many elderly people, so there is still a lot to rely on paper media advertising, but it’s better time to make it.
あまり詳しくはないので、シンプルなデザインにはなると思いますが、作成してみようと思います。	I'm not that well versed so the design will be simple but I'm thinking of trying to make one.	I don't know much about it, so I think it's a simple design, but I'm going to try it.
そうか、頼んだよ。	Okay, I'll leave it to you.	Yes, I asked you.
井上さんも手伝ってあげてくれるかい？	Inoue-san, can you help him?	Would you like to help me Mr. Moore?
わかりました。	Okay.	I realized.
ウェブサイトが出来たら、電話帳の広告や、社用車にもアドレスを追加した方がいいですね。	Once the website is done, we should add the web address on the phone booklet, advertisement, and company car too.	If you can access the website, you should add an address to your telephone book advertisements and your company car.
社員の写真や会社の写真、作業が完了した家のビフォーアフターの写真などを出来るだけたくさん載せたいのですが。	I want to add photos of the employees, company and before-after photos of houses we worked on as much as possible.	I would like to post as many photos of employees, photos of the company, photos of the house after the work completed, etc. as much as possible.
写真なら一箇所にデータでまとまっているはずだから、そこからいくらでも使って大丈夫だよ。	We have the photos saved in one folder so you can use as much as you'd like.	The photos should be gathered in one piece of data, so it’s okay to use any of them.
お客様の許可も得た方が良いですよね？	We should get permission from the clients too, right?	It’s better to get the customer’s permission, right?
そうだね、それは私から連絡しよう。	Yeah, I'll contact them on this.	Yes, I’m going to contact you.
写真を見て、どの家を載せるか決まったらリストにまとめて持って来てくれるかな。	Can you look at the pictures and list up which houses you want to upload and show me?	If you look at the photos and decide which house you can place, you can bring it to the list.
わかりました。	Okay.	I realized.
そう言えば来年の電話帳への記載に変更がないかの確認メールが先日届いていました。	Come to think of it, we got an email the other day asking us if there will be any changes for next year's phonebook.	It was confirmed that there was no change in the list of the next year's telephone book.
確か、変更があるなら今月中に連絡を入れなければいけないはずです。	I recall it saying that we need to let them know by this month if there will be changes.	If there are any changes, you must contact us this month.
では急いで作って、出来れば間に合わせたいですね。	Then we should make it quickly and hopefully be able to meet the deadline.	So you want to make it quickly, and if you can, you want to make it in time.
でも意外と多いのが、スーパーとか市民会館に貼らせていただいているチラシだったり、近所の人がうちの会社で外壁を直したからっていう問合せなんだよね。	But surprisingly there are a lot that are flyers that we have posted at supermarkets and community centers, and we get inquiries that locals used our company to repair their exterior walls.	But it’s surprising that many people ask that they’re putting them in the supermarkets or citizens’ halls, or that a neighbor has fixed the walls in our company.
ではそちらも出来上がり次第、サイトのアドレスを追加して貼り直します。	Okay, I will add the website URL and repost it once those are done as well.	Then, as soon as you come out, you will add the address of the site and reinsert it.
私が通っている整体の病院にも名刺を置いてくれるって言ってたから、それも記載を追加しないとね。	The chiropractic hospital that I go to said they can let me leave business cards there so we should add it on there too.	I told him that he would leave a card in the entire hospital that I was going to go through, so I need to add it to the list.
ウェブサイトが出来上がってからも忙しくなりそうですね。	It seems we will be busy once the website is finished too.	You will be busy after your website comes out.
予約もウェブ上で取れるように将来的にはする予定ですが、まだそこまでの知識がないので、どうしましょう？	I plan on adding a feature so we can take reservations online in the future but I don't have that much knowledge on it so what should we do?	I'm planning to make a book on the web in the future, but as I don't know so much, what do I do?
とりあえず問合せ先に社の番号、予約までは取れなくても問い合わせをウェブ上で出来るようになっていると良いかな。	Well let's at least have our company number in the contact information and have them be able to contact us over the web even if it's not taking reservations.	I hope you will be able to contact the company’s number, even if you don’t get the reservation, and you will be able to contact them on the web.
それぐらいなら大丈夫だと思います。	I think I should be able to do something like that.	I think that’s okay.
お客様がウェブで問い合わせをすると、社のメールに通知が来るように出来ます。	I will make it so we will get a notification on our company email when a customer makes an inquiry over the web.	When the customer is contacted on the web, you can get a notification to the company's email.
ではその返信などを担当する者も決めて置いた方が良さそうですね。	Then we should decide who will be in charge of replying those.	So it is better for those who are responsible for the answer.
ウェブサイトが出来上がったら、もう一度会議を開きましょう。	Let's have another meeting once the website is done.	Once the website comes out, we will open the meeting again.
では田中さん、井上さん、よろしくお願いします。	Alright, I'll leave it to you guys Tanaka-san and Inoue-san.	Mr. Tandy, Mr. Tandy, please please.
新しいお弁当屋さん出てたよ。	There is a new bento place.	The new restaurant came out.
どんな感じ？	What's it like?	How do you feel?
タイとベトナムとラオス料理の融合って感じ。	Kind of like a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisine.	It is a combination of Thai, Vietnam and Laos cuisine.
でも作ってる人はタイ人だったから、タイ料理がお勧めかも。	But the person making it is Thai so Thai food might be good.	But the people who make it were Thai, so I would recommend Thai cuisine.
えー、私ベトナム料理の方が好きなんだけどな。	Oh, I actually like Vietnamese food though.	I prefer Vietnamese cuisine.
でもジュリーが好きなのはフォーでしょ。	But Julie, you only like pho, right?	But it’s what Julie likes.
汁の麺類は弁当っていうか、持ち帰りにすると美味しくないよね？	Don't you think a noodle and soup for take out wouldn't taste good?	It’s good for me to eat a meal and it’s not good for me to bring it home, right?

今日はパッタイ買ってきた、味見する？	I bought pad-thai today, do you want to try it?	I’ve bought the cake today, do you taste it?
する、ありがとう。	Yes, thank you.	Do it, thank you.
美味しいね、私も見てこよ！	This is good, I'll go take a look too.	It’s delicious, I’m going to see it too!
薬味の匂いが強いのはやめた方がいいよ。	I'd avoid the ones with strong herbal smells.	It is better to stop the smell of the drug.
うちの食堂狭いから、匂いが気になる人もいると思う。	Our cafeteria is small and there are people who would not be happy with the smell.	Because the room is small, some people are interested in the smell.
オッケー。	Okay.	OK is.
グリーンカレーと生春巻き買ってきた！	I bought green curry and summer roll.	I’ve bought green curry!
美味しそう！	That looks good.	It looks delicious!
2人とも何食べてるの？	What are you two eating?	What do you eat both?
タイ料理、ビルの目の前の弁当屋台に新しく増えたみたいです。	Thai food, there is a new bento stall in front of the building.	The Thai cuisine appears to be new in the dining room in front of the building.
美味しいですよ！	It's good!	It is delicious!
カロリー考えずいっぱい食べられる細身女子はいいねー。	I'm jealous of skinny girls who can eat what a lot without worrying about the calories.	It’s not good for a girl to eat a lot of calories.
それってセクハラとか、何ハラとかわかんないけどタブーワードじゃない？	Isn't that like sexual harassment or some sort of harassment, and it shouldn't be something you should say, right?	I don’t know what it is or what it is, but it’s not a taboo.
お、容姿について話すのはやめとくか。	Oh, I guess I shouldn't talk about appearances.	Stop talking about the appearance.
そうだよ、最近何かとうるさいから気をつけな！	Yeah, you should be careful as that's something the company is pretty stringent on.	Well, you’ve got a lot of trouble recently, so be careful!
それにしても、うちの社食はなんで主食1品、副菜2品なんてめんどくさいルールになったわけ？	But still, how come our company cafeteria has an annoying rule of only 1 main dish and 2 side dishes?	So, why do we make our food as one, two, and two?
バッフェ形式だとケンみたいに食べすぎる人がいて、採算取れなくなったんじゃない？	Because if we have a buffet, people like Ken will eat too much and maybe they aren't able to make a profit?	There are people who eat too much buffet like Ken, and they can’t get it?
勘弁してよー、俺そんなに食べないよ。	Oh please, I don't eat that much.	I’m sorry, I’m not eating so much.
みんな知ってるよ、皿に毎回大盛りなの。	We all know that you always put a lot on your plate.	Everyone knows that it’s big on the dish every time.
腹が減っては仕事はできぬ！	You can't work if you're hungry!	You’re hungry and you can’t work!
でた、戦国時代か。	There it is, you and your Sengoku period quotes.	It was the time of war.
隣のビルの事務所に転職しようかな。	Maybe I should go work at the office in the building beside from us.	I want to switch to the office in the nearby building.
噂ですよね、隣のビルの食堂は美味しいって。	They say that the cafeteria is the building next to us is really good.	It is a rumor that the restaurant nearby is delicious.
そう、職場の環境って大事だよね。	Yeah, the work environment is important.	The workplace environment is important.
特に俺みたいな大食いには、食の環境ってとっても大事なわけよ。	Especially for a big eater like me, where the food environment is very important.	Especially for foods like me, the food environment is very important.
うちら細身女子は、食べられる量が少ないから余計中身重視なのよ。	Us slim girls can't eat a lot so we're more focused on the content.	The female body is too small because it is too small to eat.
だから、うちの社食が毎日じゃ、いくらタダでも生き抜いていけないわけ。	So, if we eat at the company cafeteria everyday, we can't survive even if it's free.	That is why our food is daily and we can’t survive as much as free.
俺はタダより美味い飯はないと思う。	Well, I think there is no better meal than a free meal.	I don’t think there’s any more delicious food than free.
って事で、社食とってこよっと。	So, I will go grab some of the company meal.	So, you have a social meal.
今日はケンさんの嫌いなグリービーンズ盛り盛りのおかずですよ。	They have loads of green peas that you don't like as the side dish today.	Today, we’re looking forward to Kane’s hated green beans.
えー、俺も弁当買いに行かないとかな？	Oh, maybe I have to go buy a bento too?	Do I have to go to buy meals too?
ケン、昼休み終わっちゃうよー。	Ken, lunch break is almost over.	Ken, the lunch is over.
よお、海瑠、今日はお疲れさん。	Hey, Kyle, good work today.	Goodbye, marshmallow, goodbye today.
あれ海棠部長、もう帰られたのかと思ってましたが。	Oh, Kiichi, I thought you've left already.	And I thought that shepherd had already come home.
ワークショップの件でまだ何か？	Do you still have something you'd like to ask about the workshop?	Is there anything else about the workshop?
いや特に、お前と話がしたかっただけ。	Not really, I just wanted to talk to you.	Especially I just wanted to talk to you.
この後まだ仕事か？	Are you still working after this?	Are you still working after that?
今日は確か...	I believe I have....	Today I am sure...
いえ、打ち合わせが金曜に延期になったんでした。	No, a meeting has been postponed until Friday.	The meeting was delayed on Friday.
今日はこれで終わりですね。	I'm done for the day now.	This is over today, right?
じゃ、一杯付き合えるな。	Then, you can join me for a drink, huh?	Don’t get a drink together.
相変わらず強引ですね、部長。	You always push me too much, Kiichi.	It’s always as hard, Mr.
な、久しぶりだろ？	Oh well, it's been a long time, you know?	Have you met for a long time, right?

お前も飲むのは嫌いじゃないだろうに。	You rather like drinking, don't you?	You will not like to drink either.
場所と相手によりますよ。	It all depends on where and with whom I drink.	Depending on the place and the other.
じゃ、俺はお眼鏡にかなったんだな？	So I passed your test, I guess?	I’ve got my glasses, right?
ええ、喜んでください。	Yeah, you should be proud.	Yes, please be happy.
私は結構繊細で、人を選ぶタイプなので。	I'm quite sensitive and particular about people.	I am very sensitive and a type of person to choose.
はは、俺相手にそんだけの口がきければ上等だよ、海瑠。	Ha-ha, not bad if you can talk to me like that, Kyle!	If you want to talk to me, it’s good.
入社の時からあなたみたいな疲れ知らずの上司に連れ回されましたからね。	I had been taken around by a tireless boss like you since I started working.	You have been brought back to an untouched boss like you.
誰でもたくましくなります。	Anybody would be tough.	Everybody will get crazy.
お前みたいに反抗的だが真面目な新入り仕込むのは楽しかった。	I enjoyed training disobedient but earnest newbie like you.	It was pleasant to have a rebellious but serious new entrance as you.
そうですね、８年の長きに亘って。	You did, for eight long years.	Yes, for eight years.
お陰様で、今ではどんなお偉方も平気ですよ、かなりクセのある方でも。	Thanks to you, I can deal with any important people now, even pretty difficult ones.	Thank you, all of you are well now, even if you’re pretty good.
じゃ、今のお前があるのは俺のお陰って事だな。	That means you owe what you are today to me, right?	You are now there because of me.
部長、あなたのそのプラス思考には敵いませんよ。	No one can think as positive as you do, Kiichi.	I am not enemy of your pluss thinking.
ああ、お前に言いたい事がある。	Well, I have something to say, Kyle.	Oh, I have something to say to you.
お前が経営企画に引っ張られた時、あそこがエリートコースだから営業抜けさせたんだ。	When you got promoted to the corporate planning, I let you leave the sales because you'd get into the fast lane there.	When you were pulled into the management project, there was the elite course, and I made it out of business.
４年で異動希望、それもマーケに出すなら、手放すんじゃなかった。	If I knew that you were going to request a transfer in four years to marketing too, I wouldn't have let you go.	In four years of hopes and hopes, it would not be left.
あなたに育てていただいたので、今独り立ちできてるんです。	You've raised me so that I can stand on my own now.	I have grown up for you and you are alone now.
すぐCX企画部の評価を上げて見せますよ。	I'll show you that I'm capable of building up a reputation for CX promotion soon.	Soon we will show you the assessment of the CX project.
あー、わかったよ、どんだけ巧くやるんだか見ててやるよ。	Ah, okay, I'll see how artfully you do that.	Oh, I’m going to see how smart you’re doing.
はは、楽しんでいただけると思います。	Ha Ha, I think you'll enjoy it.	I think you will enjoy it.
とりあえず、昔行ってた蕎麦屋でいいだろ？	Anyway, you don't mind the soba place we used to go, do you?	It’s a food shop you’ve been in before, right?
この時期は美味い日本酒入れてるぞ。	They have fine sake this time of the year.	This time we have a delicious Japanese wine.
いいですね。	Sounds good.	Well well well.
オフィス戻って鞄取ってきますね。	I'll go back to my office to get my bag.	Go back to the office and take it.

先週から退職貯蓄の設定をしてるんだよ。	I've been setting up my retirement from the past week.	I have set up retirement savings since last week.
君はどう設定した？	How do you have your savings for retirement set up?	How did you set up?
僕は全部A社の株に投資してるよ。	All of mine is invested into Company A stock.	I’m investing in all of the company’s shares.
A社は給与の4％までの貯蓄分には同額を補助してくれるから。	Company A matches everything that we put in up to four percent.	The company will provide the same amount of savings up to 4% of its salary.

ただ、自社株だけに投資したせいで、退職後の夢に敗れてしまった人々は沢山いるからね。	However, many people have watched their retirement dreams disappear because they invested only in the company stock of their employer.	Just because they invested in their own shares, there are many people who lost their dreams after retirement.

気をつけたほうがいいよって言いたかっただけだよ、ティム。	I'm just looking out for you, Tim.	I just wanted to say you should be careful, Tim.
ほとんどの人が君と同じようにするけど、長期的にみると効率よくないからさ。	Most people do exactly what you do, but in the long term, it doesn't make sense.	Most people do the same as you, but in the long run it’s not effective.
僕もそうしてたんだけど、色々調べ始めたんだよ。	I was doing it too, but I started doing some research.	I did so, but I started to investigate a lot.
そうか、じゃあどうしたらいいの？	Well then, what do you suggest?	Yes, then what should I do?
いいかい、もしA社が失敗したら株の価値はなくなって全てを失うことになるだろ？	Here's the thing, if Company A fails, we lose everything and the stock will be worthless.	If a company fails, the stock will not be worth and you will lose everything.
ターゲットデート・ミューチュアルファンドがいいよ。	Go with a target-date mutual fund.	You have a target dating mutual fund.
何それ？	What's that?	What is that?

新年のカレンダーが届いたかどうか知りたいのですが。	I would like to know whether the new year calendar has arrived or not?	I want to know if the new year’s calendar has arrived.
申し訳ないです、メールにも書いた通り、新年のカレンダーが届くのは遅れるかもしれません。	I'm sorry, as I wrote in the email the new year calendar might arrive late.	Sorry, as I wrote in the email, the new year’s calendar may be late.
あらら、じゃ、うちのオフィスにはいつ納品されますか？	Oh, so when it will be delivered to our office?	When will we be delivered to our office?

分かりました、あと、カレンダーは業者から一括してではなく、幾つかのバッチに分けて送られる予定だということもお伝えしておきますね。	Okay, I would also like to tell you that our vendor will not send the calendar to your office at once, but divided into several batches.	I know, then I will tell you that the calendar will not be shared by the supplier, but will be distributed into several bats.
なので、200部注文されたとしたら、まず50部ほどお渡しできます。	So, maybe if you ordered 200 pieces, I can give you around 50 pieces at first.	If you have ordered 200 pieces, you can first deliver 50 pieces.
それから、次の日に業者からまた送られてきたら、さらに50部お渡しできます。	And then, if our vendor send it again the next day, I can give you another 50 calendars.	Then, if you get sent again from the supplier the next day, you can deliver another 50 pieces.
これは、全国の支社にもカレンダーを届ける必要があるからなんです。	This is because we also need to deliver the calendar to our branch offices throughout the country.	This is because it is necessary to deliver calendar to the country’s branches.
それに、支社に届ける時間が必要なので。	And we need time for delivery to our branch offices.	It also takes time to deliver to the company.
はい、分かりました。	Okay, I understand that.	Yes, I understand it.
とにかくカレンダーが用意できたら教えてください。	Just please inform me when the calendars are ready.	Please tell me if the calendar is available.
もうすでに遅れてますから。	Because it's already late.	Because it is already late.
分かりました。	Okay.	I understood.

今、そういうことは罰金の対象になるのは知ってるよね、ナンバープレートは覚えてる？	You know they can get fined for that now, did you catch their number plate?	Now you know that it will be subject to a penalty, do you remember the number plate?
いや、残念ながらあっという間の出来事だったから。	No, unfortunately it all happened too fast.	Unfortunately, it was a very quick event.
ま、何にしても、この状態で間に合うのは絶対無理だ。	But anyway, there's no way I'm going to make it in on time now.	No matter what, you can’t get in time in this situation.

皆さん、こんにちは、今日はお集まりくださいましてありがとうございます。	Hello all, thank you for gathering today.	Hi guys, thank you for gathering today.
ユーチン、今日はサイラーがいるので、全員英語でもいいでしょうか？	Yichin do you mind if we all speak English today as Sylar is here?	Youtine, today there’s a silver, so all can be in English?
もちろん大丈夫です、サイラー、元気ですか？	Of course not, how are you Sylar?	You’re okay, Sylvester, you’re okay?
やあ、ユーチン、声が聞けて良かったよ。	Hi Yichin, good to hear your voice.	Oh yeah, I am glad you heard the voice.
オーストラリアはどう？	How is Australia?	What about Australia?
実はうだるような暑さですよ。	Sweltering actually.	In fact, it is so hot.
東京の方がまだましでした、ここに戻るのはうんざりです。	Tokyo was much better, it sucks to be back here.	Tokyo is still better, and I’m tired of returning here.
さて、当社に関するあなた方のファンドの考えについて、全員同じ認識だということを確認するため、今日はお2人にも電話で参加してもらいました。	So I've got you 2 on the phone because I wanted to make sure we are on the same page regarding your fund's intentions with our company.	Well, to make sure that you all have the same awareness about your funds about us, today you both got to join by telephone.
サイラーからは、懸念があるとのフィードバックを内々でいただいています。	Sylar has given me some feedback in confidence as to some concerns he has.	Sylvester is concerned about his feedback.
そう、その件に関しては、サイラーからEメールをもらっています。	Yes, I got an email from Sylar regarding that.	Yes, I have received an e-mail from Sylvester.
サイラーの懸念はワン フェイホン社長に伝えてあり、フェイホンは御社の今後の方向性を考えるため過去の資金繰りを確認しています。	I've taken his concern to Wang Feihong and he has been looking at past financials to see where you may be heading.	Syler's concerns have been told to President One Feyhon, and Feyhon has confirmed his past funding to consider the future direction of his company.
ここだけの話、もちろんサイラーもいますが、あまり良い状況ではありません。	Just between you and me, and Syler of course, this doesn't look good.	There is only a story about it, and of course there is also a silver, but it’s not very good.
ワン フェイホンは、恵子さんが、なんと言いましょうか、えー、慎重であることを主に気にしています。	Wang Feihong is mostly concerned at how, what's the word, um, careful, Keiko is.	One Feyhon is primarily concerned about what Mr. Yuki can say, yeah, be cautious.
ユーチン、いいんです、言葉を選ばなくてもいいですよ。	Yichin, it's fine, you don't have to sugar coat.	Yuri, you have no choice of words.
恵子さんは頑固で時間がかかりすぎると。	She is way too stubborn and slow.	Yuri is hard and takes a lot of time.
フェイホンは、そろそろ何らかの変革があることを期待していたのですが、悪くはなっていないにしろ、変わってないようで。	He was expecting some sort of change by now, but it seems to be the same, if not worse.	Feyhon expected that there would be some change right now, but it doesn’t seem bad, it doesn’t change.
ユジーナ、役員会議は最悪でしたよ。	Eugina, the board meeting was a disaster.	Joanna, the board meeting was the worst.
恵子さんはアレックスを制止して、私の質問もうやむやにしました。	She was shutting Alex off, and dancing around my questions.	He stopped Alex and stopped my question.
ワン フェイホンがあの会議に同席することなんて考えられません。	I can't imagine Wang Feihong himself sitting at that meeting.	We can’t think that One Faithon will be attending that meeting.
あの人、爆発しますよ。	He will explode.	He will explode.
そうですね、あなたの質問には全く答えなかったと言ってましたね。	Yes, you told me she didn't answer any of your questions..	Yes, you said you did not answer your question at all.
当社は御社の最大の投資元の一つなのに、非常に失礼です。	It's very disrespectful as we are one of your biggest investors.	We are one of your biggest investors, but we are very disappointed.
当社の経営陣のふるまいについては、深くお詫びを申し上げる以外に言葉もございません。	I don't know what to say other than I deeply apologize for their behavior.	There is no word for the behavior of our management except to express profound apologies.
恵子さん、大丈夫ですかね？	Is she okay though?	Yuki, is it okay?
といいますと？	Meaning?	Do you want?
えーと、あの方、その、よくわかりませんが、心身衰弱かなんかでしょうかね？	Well, is she, um, having some sort of, I don't know, breakdown?	I don’t know, I don’t know, but it’s a mental weakness.
どうしてあそこまで自分の世界に行っちゃってるのか、理解できないんです。	I don't understand how she can live in la-la land that long.	I don’t understand why you’ve gone so far into your world.
何かおかしいですよね、恵子さんの健康状態が心配ですよ。	There seems to be something wrong and I'm worried for her wellbeing.	I am worried about the health of Yuri.

モストウさん、大変ありがとうございました。	Thank you very much Mr. Mostow.	Mr. Moore, I am very grateful.
さて、早速始めましょうか。	Alright, let's get right into it then.	So, let’s start quickly?
CPTPPは11か国間の貿易協定です。	The CPTPP is a new trade agreement between eleven countries.	CPTPP is a trade agreement between 11 countries.
その11のうち、7か国が正式に参加していますが、一方残りの4か国はまだ検討中の状態にあります。	Of the eleven, seven countries have already officially joined while the remaining four are still in the discussion phase.	Seven of the 11 countries have officially participated, while the remaining four countries are still under consideration.
署名した7か国は、メキシコ、日本、カナダ、シンガポール、ニュージーランド、オーストラリア、ベトナムです。	The seven countries that have signed on are, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and Vietnam.	The seven signed countries are Mexico, Japan, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and Vietnam.
残りの4か国は、ブルネイ、チリ、マレーシア、ペルーとなっています。	The four remaining are, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, and Peru.	The remaining four countries are Brunei, Chile, Malaysia and Peru.
この貿易協定の目玉となるのは、多数の製品にかかる関税の引き下げもしくは撤廃です。	So the biggest feature of this trade deal will be the reduction or removal of tariffs on a large number of goods.	The goal of this trade agreement is to reduce or abolish the tariffs on a large number of products.
カナダにとって、大きな利点の一つは、アジア市場への肉製品にかかる関税の引き下げです。	For Canada, one of the biggest benefit is the reduction of tariffs for meat products in to the Asian market.	One of the major advantages for Canada is the reduction of tariffs on meat products to the Asian market.
カナダの主要市場の一つが日本なので、肉製品の貿易が大幅に増えることを予測しています。	One of Canada's key market will be Japan and we expect the trade of meat products to increase greatly.	As one of Canada’s major markets is Japan, we expect the trade in meat products to increase significantly.
主要製品は牛肉と豚肉になります。	Key products will be beef and pork.	The main products are cow and pork.
さて、関税だけでなく、協定は国々の間にその他の利益ももたらします。	Now aside from the tariffs, the deal also brings other benefits among the countries.	Well, not only the customs, but the agreement will bring other benefits between the countries.
例えば、これによって他の国の他の企業が、政府との契約に入札する機会を持つことができます。	For example, this will open up opportunities for other companies in other countries to bid for government contracts.	For example, this allows other companies in other countries to have the opportunity to offer contracts with the government.
典型的に、政府の契約には、地元の企業だけが入札できるのですが、これによって変わるでしょう。	Typically, government contracts can only be bid by the local companies but this will change that.	Typically, government contracts can only be offered by local companies, but this will change.
そして、関税引き下げもしくは撤廃によって、外国企業が海外での政府契約入札においてより競争力をもつことが出来るようになります。	And with the reduction or removal of tariffs, it will allow foreign companies to be more competitive in bidding for government contracts abroad.	And by reducing or withdrawing tariffs, foreign companies will be able to become more competitive in government contracts offerings abroad.
つまり、貿易協定は、単なる関税の引き下げや撤廃だけでなく、関係国の発展を促す他の機能も持つのです。	So the trade deal is not a simple reduction or removal of tariffs but has other features to promote the prosperity of the countries involved.	That is, the trade agreement has not only the reduction or withdrawal of tariffs, but also other functions to encourage the development of the stakeholders.
何時間でも話すことができますが、まだまだこの先丸々一日ありますので、この辺で止めておきますね。	I could go on for hours but since we still have a whole day ahead of us, I will stop around here.	You can talk about it for hours, but there’s still a whole day ahead, so I’m going to stop here.
では、この後は、政府機関Aの貿易委員の方々とのパネルセッションになります。	So after this, we will have a panel session with the trade commissioners from Government Agency A.	Then there will be a panel session with the government agency A’s trade committees.
彼らは貿易協定の利点に関する見通しを教えてくれ、企業が利用することのできるいくつかの政府プログラムについて説明してくれます。	They will provide their insight on the benefits of the trade deal, and explain some of the government programs that companies could use.	They will show you a perspective on the advantages of trade agreements and explain some government programs that companies can take advantage of.
これらは、輸出業者が新しい市場へ進出するのに利用できる可能性のあるものだと思います。	These would be things that exporters could potentially use to expand to a new market.	I think these are the possibilities that exporters can use to enter a new market.
パネルセッションは、私の後ろにある部屋で開かれますので、この後、どうぞそちらに向かってください。	The panel session will be held in the room behind me so please head on over after this.	The panel session will be open in the room behind me, so then, please go there.
ありがとうございました、そして、皆さんが今日のイベントで多くを学ばれることを願っています。	Thank you and I hope everyone learns a lot from today's event.	Thank you, and I hope you will learn a lot about this event today.

えーと、皆さんご存知のとおり、商品名についてすごく良いブレーンストーミングのセッションができまして、当社のブランドとコンセプトをとてもよく反映している候補名がいくつか上がりました。	Well, as you all know, we had a great brainstorming session for the product name, and came up with some options that we thought reflected our brand and the concept really well.	Well, as you all know, there was a very good brand-stoming session about the brand name, and there were a few candidates that very well reflect our brand and concept.
そうか。	Yes.	And yes.
ですが、残念なことに、一押しだった候補については、既に同じ商品名があるということで、その後法務部から連絡を受けて却下されました。	Unfortunately, the legal team has since got back to us and rejected our number one candidate, as there is already a product with that name.	However, unfortunately, the one-pressed candidate has already the same product name and was later contacted by the Department of Justice and rejected.
そして、もう一つの有力候補はスペイン語では下品とみなされるようで、振り出しに戻ってしまいました。	Another favorite could apparently be deemed offensive in Spanish, so it looks like it's back to the drawing board.	And another powerful candidate appeared to be considered a low product in Spanish, and returned to the outskirts.
心配するな、まだ時間はある。	Not to worry, it's still early days.	Don’t worry, there’s still time.
さて、この辺で切り上げるとするかな。	Right, let's wrap it up there.	So, you can cut it around here.
２週間後にまた集まって、進捗を報告してもらいます。	We'll reconvene in 2 weeks to share what progress we've made.	We will meet again in two weeks to report the progress.
A社からもう返事は来た？	Did you hear back from Company A yet?	Have you received an answer from the company?
いや、まだなんです。	No, not yet.	No, it is still.
メールは先週送りました。	I sent them an email last week.	I sent the email last week.
もし返事がなかったら今週金曜日にフォローアップする予定なんです。	I'm planning to follow up with them on Friday this week if I don't hear back.	If you don’t answer, I’m going to follow you on Friday this week.
先方に電話してみるのは？	Why don't you try calling them?	Do you try to call before?
実は担当者さんが今週は国外にいるので、メールに返信もらえるのを期待してたんです。	Actually the person in charge is out of the country this week so I was hoping he'd reply my email.	In fact, the officer was abroad this week, so I was looking forward to receiving an email.
彼は今ヨーロッパに居て、電話で連絡するのはちょっと難しいんですよ。	He's in Europe right now and it's a bit hard to reach him by phone.	He is now in Europe and it’s a bit difficult to contact by telephone.
というか、自分が出張の時に誰から電話かかってきてほしくないんですよね。	I mean, I wouldn't want someone calling me when I'm on a business trip.	You don’t want to call anyone when you’re on your trip.
特に寝てるときとか。	Especially when I'm sleeping or something.	Especially when you sleep.
そうか、それはそうだな。	Okay, fair enough.	Yes, that is yes.
でもこの件、フォローアップをするの忘れないように。	Be sure to follow up on this though.	But don’t forget to follow this.
東京でうちのチームが返事を待ってるから、少なくとも今週末までにどうなっているか連絡したほうがいい。	Our team in Tokyo has been waiting for a reply and we should at least let them know what is up by the end of this week.	Our team in Tokyo is waiting for an answer, so it is better to know what’s going on at least this weekend.
はい、わかりました。	Yes, I understand.	Yes I realized.
どちらにしても金曜日に東京のチームに報告します。	I'll update the team in Tokyo on Friday regardless.	We will report to the team on Friday.
ありがとう。	Thank you.	thank you.
やあローラ、今ちょっといい？	Hey Laura, can we talk for a bit now?	Laura, is it a bit better now?
うん、いいよ！	Yeah, sure!	Yes, it is OK!
良かった。	Great.	It was good.
あっ、そういえば、お休みどうだった？	Oh by the way, how was your holiday?	So, what about your vacation?
リスボン楽しめた？	Did you enjoy Lisbon?	Have you Lisbon?
すっごく良かった！	Oh it was brilliant!	It was very good!
天気は最高、ご飯も美味しいしみんな優しくて！	The weather was perfect, food was great, people were all so nice!	The weather is great, the food is delicious and everyone is gentle!
ポールはエッグタルトにハマって滞在中毎日最低3個は食べてた。	Paul got himself addicted to the egg tarts and he was eating at least 3 everyday throughout the stay.	Paul eaten at least three foods a day during his stay.
あはは！	Haha!	It is!
最近は家でも作ろうとしてレシピをひたすらググってるわ。	He's now relentlessly googling the recipe so that he can recreate it.	Recently, I have been trying to make a recipe at home.
いいね！	Oh that's nice!	Well well!
僕の分も作ってくれるように言っといて。	Make sure he cooks some for me too.	Tell me to make my part.
もちろん！	Definitely!	of course!
オッケー、えっと、来週にT社とのミーティングをしたくて、君がいつ空いてるか知りたかったんだよね。	Ok, so, I wanted to set a meeting with Company T next week and I was wondering when you would be available to attend.	Okay, yeah, I want to meet with the company next week and you want to know when you are free.
先方はいつでも大丈夫みたいだから、僕たちの都合で決めていい。	Basically they can do any day so it's up to us.	We always think it’s okay, so we can choose it for us.
ああ、そうだよね、外に出れる日が、ちょっと待ってね、予定確認する。	Oh yeah, I will be able to go out, give me a sec, let me check my schedule.	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
オッケー、水曜日と木曜日は外出できる。	Ok, I can do Wednesday and Thursday.	OK, you can go out on Wednesday and Thursday.
金曜日も午後2時以降なら。	Also Friday but only after 2 p.m.	Friday after 2 p.m.
午前中はずっと会議で、その後すぐ指導担当の後輩とランチの約束があるんだ。	I will have a meeting all morning and a lunch appointment with my trainee right after that.	In the morning there is a meeting, and immediately afterwards there is a promise for lunch with the instructor's followers.
了解、ありがとう！	Ok thanks!	I understand, thank you!
僕も水曜日空いてるからちょうどいいや。	I can do Wednesday too so that's great.	I’m free on Wednesday, so well.
先方にメールで伝えて、時間が決まったらまた言うね。	I will email them then set the time and let you know.	I'll tell you by email, and I'll tell you again when the time is fixed.
了解。	Ok, sounds great.	to understand.
ミーティングまでに必要な書類のリストをリマインドのために自分たち宛に送っておくね。	I will send us the list of documents we need by then to remind us.	Send a list of documents you need before the meeting to Remastered.
ありがとう！	Thanks!	Thank you!
すみません、新しい文房具がほしいんですけど。	Excuse me, I would like to get some stationery.	Sorry, I want a new room.
どんな種類の文房具？	What kind of stationery?	What kind of room equipment?
赤い水性サインペンが欲しいんだけど。	I want a red non-permanent marker.	I want a red water signature.
備品棚に在庫なかった？	Didn't you see it on the supply shelf?	Do you have no stock in the warehouse?
探してみたんだけど見つからなくって。	I looked for it but didn't find it.	I tried it, but I didn’t find it.
倉庫に在庫があるかもしれない。	We might have some in the storage.	There may be a stock in the warehouse.
すぐに必要？	Do you need it soon?	Needed immediately?
できれば早めに欲しいな。	The sooner the better.	If you can, want it early.
じゃあ、今見てくるけど。	Ok, I will go see it now.	So, I will see it now.
お願いします。	Please do.	Please please.
それと、ついでにもう一ついい？	Can I ask you one more favor?	And finally another good thing?
何？	What is it?	What is?
こっちは急ぎじゃないんだけど、ハサミも新しいのが欲しい。	This is no rush, but I would like a new pair of scissors.	I don’t have a hurry, but I want something new.
ハサミも備品棚になくて。	There weren't any scissors on the supply shelf either.	I don’t want to have a shelf as well.
新しいハサミは備品棚に置いてないよ。	We don't keep new scissors on the supply shelf.	The new shells are not placed in the warehouse.
備品棚においてあるのは基本的に消耗品だから。	We only keep consumable goods on the supply shelf.	In the warehouses, it is essentially consumption.
そうなんだ、どうすればいい？	I see, what should I do?	Yes, what should I do?
サインペンと一緒に倉庫の在庫を見てみるよ。	I will see if there are some along with markers.	Take a look at the warehouse with the signature.
もしあったら、すぐに渡せるけど。	I will get a pair for you right away if there are any.	If so, I can give it immediately.
なかったら業者に今日発注するから、明後日届くと思う。	If not, I will place an order from the supply company and should receive them tomorrow.	If not, I will order to the supplier today and I hope it will arrive later.
了解です。	I gotcha.	I understand.
あ、そうだ、備品棚の持ち出し表、全部の欄が埋まってたよ。	Oh, another thing, the take-out chart was completely filled.	Oh yeah, the output tables, all the boxes were filled.
新しい用紙を出しておいた方がいいよ。	You should probably get a new one out.	You should have a new paper.
ありがとう、早速やっておくよ。	Thank you, I will get to it right away.	Thank you, I will do it quickly.
うちの会社のエントランスって殺風景ですよね。	Isn't the entrance to our company a little drab?	The entrance of our company is a murder scene.
掃除はしているけど、シンプル過ぎるっていうか。	It gets cleaned regularly but it is too plain.	I’m cleaning it, but it’s too simple.
まぁ、華やかな感じじゃないよね。	Well, it's definitely not vibrant.	Well, it doesn’t feel great, right?
エントランス入ったら、社名があって応接セットと内線電話だけですからね。	When you come into the entrance, all you see is the company name, the reception furniture, and the telephone.	If you enter the entrance, there is a company name and only the contact set and the internal phone.
一応、観葉植物もあるけどね。	Well, a plant is there too.	Of course, there are also plants.
でも、この観葉植物も会社が移転した時に取引先からお祝いで頂いたものですし。	But we got this plant as a gift from our client when our office moved.	However, this plant is also celebrated when the company moved.
ちょっと枯れてきちゃっている部分もありますよね。	Some of the leaves are dying though.	Some of them are somewhat dead.
高田さんは、結構色んな会社訪問してるじゃないですか？	Takada-san, you have visited many companies, haven't you?	Do you think Mr. Goethe is visiting a lot of companies?
印象に残っている会社のエントランスとかあります？	Do you remember any company that has an impressive entrance?	Is there any entrance of the company that remains impressed?
会社の規模によって全然違うから、一概にうちの参考にはならないけど。	Since it varies greatly depending on the size of a company, it might not be very useful.	This is completely different from the size of the company, but it is not our reference.
今までで一番インパクトがあったのは、J証券かな。	The most impressive one by far is J brokerage.	The biggest impact ever was the J Securities.
外資系の大手投資銀行だから、全く参考にはならないんだけど。	It is a large international brokerage firm, so it's not helpful to compare though.	As a major foreign investment bank, I don’t know anything about it.
どんな感じなんですか？	How was it?	How do you feel?
ワンフロアすべて受付。	The whole floor is dedicated to the reception area.	One floor is all accepted.
しかも、東京駅隣接のビルの１８階で一面ガラス張りだから見張らしのいいこと、いいこと。	In addition, it's 18th floor of a building that is right next to Tokyo Station with glass windows, which offers a breathtaking view.	Also, the 18th floor of the building near the Tokyo Station is one side of the glass, so it’s a good thing to watch, a good thing.
受付のカウンターに女性が２人座っていて、受付が終わるとホテルのロビーの用なソファーに案内されて。	There are two female receptionists sitting at the front desk, and once you sign in, you will be guided to the sofa in an area that reminds you of a hotel lobby.	Two women were sitting in the reception countryside, and when the reception ended, they were guided to the sofa for the lobby of the hotel.
オフィスフロアに案内されるまで、優雅に待つという。	You can wait elegantly until you get guided to the office floor.	Wait elegantly until you are brought to the office floor.
高級ホテル並みのホスピタリティ。	As hospitable as a luxury hotel.	A luxury hotel hospitality.
それは凄すぎますね。	That sounds awesome.	It is too great, right?
じゃあ、もうちょっと身の丈にあったレベルで、よかったと思った会社はありますか？	Can you think of any company that is more like our level then?	So, is there any company that you thought it was a good level?
外資系ヘッジファンドのH投資顧問かな。	Foreign hedge fund managing company H might be it.	Investment Advisor of the Foreign Investment Fund.
どんな感じでした？	How was it?	How was it feeling?
日比谷のホテルに隣接しているオフィス棟に入っているんだけど。	It's in a building adjacent to a hotel in Hibiya.	I am in the office building next to the hotel.
そんなにエントランスが広いわけではなく、ちょうどうちの会社くらい。	The entrance isn't that big, it's probably the same size as ours.	Not so large entrances, but just as large as the company.
とにかく品があったよ。	It is very classy.	There were goods anyway.
ドアを開けると、社名のロゴが掛かっていて、ガラスのテーブルに内線電話があったよ。	When you open the door, you see the company logo hung up and a telephone placed on a glass table.	When the door was opened, the company’s logo was hanged and there was an internal phone on the glass table.
うちと一緒じゃないですか。	That sounds pretty similar to ours.	Are you not with us?
あと、大きな花瓶にいつも生花のアレンジがあって、いい香りがするんだよね。	And there was a fresh flower arrangement in a large vase, and it smelled wonderful.	There is always a large flower in the bottle and it smells good.
きつい香りじゃなくて、ほんのりフローラル。	It wasn't overpowering, just enough floral scent.	Not a hard smell, but a flower.
嗅覚をくすぐるの、有効ですよね。	Olfactory stimulation can be useful.	It makes you smell, it works.
生花のアレンジメントを飾るくらいだったら、うちも真似できるじゃないですか？	Can we borrow their idea and add a fresh flower arrangement?	If we were to decorate the flowers, can we do it too?
じゃあ、ちょっと片付けて試験的にやってみる？	Then should we straighten up and do it as a trial?	Would you try to clean it and test it?
周りの反応を見てみようかな。	Let's see how people react to it.	Let’s look at the reaction around.
いいですね、やってみましょうよ。	Sounds good, let's do it.	OK, let’s try it.
野田さん、ちょっとご相談なんですけど。	Noda-san, can I ask you something?	Nora, I want to talk to you a little.
はいはい、何でしょう？	Yes, what is it?	Yes yes, what is it?
来月１５日に、A証券さんが本社移転するんだよね。	My client, A Securities, is moving their headquarters on the fifteenth of next month.	On the 15th of May, the company will be transferred.
御祝を贈りたいんだけど、どうすればいい？	I'd like to send them a gift.	I want to give you a gift, but what do I do?
品物と予算は決まっているんですか？	Do you know what you want to send and how much you want to spend?	Are the goods and budgets fixed?
いや、逆にいつも何を贈っているのかなと思って。	I was wondering what you always send out as gifts..	I always wonder what you’re giving.
そうですね、オフィス移転の場合は観葉植物が多いでしょうか？	For a move, how about a decorative indoor plant?	Yes, if you move to the office, do you see a lot of plants?
グリーンレンタルの業者を利用している会社も多いですけど、喜ばれますよ。	There are many firms who rent potted plants for their offices, but most still seem very happy to receive something like that as a gift.	There are many companies that use Green Rental, but you will be happy.
特に、会議室や応接室が沢山あるオフィスだとインテリアとして重宝されますよ。	Especially if they have many conference and meeting rooms, they are perfect as decorations.	Especially if there are a lot of meeting rooms and reception rooms in the office, it will be valued as an interior.
それに、観葉植物だと長期間置いてもらえますからね。	They also last for a long time.	You will also be able to leave it as a plant for a long time.
あと、贈り主の名前が入った立て札を付けたままにしてあると、当社の名前がその会社に訪れた方の目につきますしね。	We can also add a plaque with our company name with the gift which will show their visiting clients our relationship.	Then, if you keep the name of the donor on the list, the name of our company will be seen in the eyes of the person who visited the company.
なるほどね。	I see.	Well as well.
種類でいうと、パキラやユッカ、ベンジャミンなんかが多いですかね。	We usually choose pachira, yucca and ficus benjamina...	There are many kinds of paquila, yucca, and benjamins.
予算は１万５千円から２万円くらいでしょうか。	Our budget is usually somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 yen.	The budget is about 15,000 yen to 20,000 yen.
種類を言われても想像できないけど、うちのエントランスにあるような植物って感じ？	I'm not familiar with those plants but are they like the ones in our entrance lobby?	I can’t imagine the species, but it feels like a plant in our entrance?
そうですね、無難な感じです。	Yes, something pretty ordinary.	Yes, it feels difficult.
じゃあ、予算は１万５千円で、種類は任せるよ。	You can choose which kind and let's spend 15,000 yen.	The budget is 15,000 yuan, and you can do it.
ちょっと大きい鉢植えを１つ贈っておいてくれる？	Let's also choose a big planter for it.	Can you give me a small plant?
了解しました。	OK, I will do that.	I understood.
立て札に記入する名前はどうしましょう？	What name should I ask to put on the plaque?	What is the name to fill in the list?
社長名でよろしく。	Please put the president's name.	Congratulations on the name of the President.
わかりました、早速手配しておきます。	Got it, I will make arrangements immediately.	I know, I will order it quickly.
今日からこちらでお世話になる小泉です、よろしくお願いします。	My name is Koizumi, pleased to meet you, I am starting today.	I am here to help you from today, please.
新人研修担当の武藤です、よろしくお願いします。	I am Muto, in charge of new recruits, pleased to meet you as well.	I am a new coach, please.
ではまず小泉さん、調理場に入る前にこの帽子を被ってください。	Koizumi san, please wear this hat before entering the kitchen.	Please wear this hat before you go to the kitchen.
髪の毛がはみ出ないように帽子に全部髪の毛を入れてくださいね。	Please make sure that no hair is showing.	Put all your hair in the hat so that your hair doesn’t come out.
髪のピン留めは付けてて大丈夫ですか？	Is it OK to put hair clips in?	Do you have a pin on your hair and is it okay?
帽子の中に入っていれば問題ありませんよ。	As long as it's inside the hat.	If you’re in the hat, there’s no problem.
次に石鹸で3分間しっかり手を洗ってからアルコールを手に吹き付けてください。	Next please properly wash your hands with soap for 3 minutes before disinfecting with alcohol.	Then wash your hands with soap for 3 minutes and then blow the alcohol into your hands.
こんなに徹底した衛生管理を行うんですね。	You take such care of hygiene!	You have such a thorough health care.
食中毒を防ぐためにはなにより衛生管理の徹底が基本ですからね。	We basically need perfect hygiene to avoid food poisoning.	For the prevention of food poisoning, health care is essential.
じゃあまずはお弁当のご飯から盛っていきましょう。	Let start packing rice for the bento boxes.	Let us start with the meal.
炊飯器から200グラム、この計りで量ってこの容器にいれてもらえますか？	Will you scoop 200 grams of rice, weigh it on this scale, and put it into the container?	Can I get 200 grams of the cooking machine, with this measurement, in this container?
200グラムぴったりって難しいですね。	It's hard to be exactly 200 grams.	200 grams is hard.
215グラム以内だったら誤差は気にしなくて大丈夫ですよ。	As long as it's within 215 grams, don't worry about the difference.	If you’re less than 215 grams, it’s okay not to worry about the error.
ただし少ないのは厳禁です。	But make sure it is not less.	But little is strictly prohibited.
たまにお客さんで家でご飯の量を量って足りないとクレーム出す人がいるんです。	Otherwise, some customers weigh the amount of rice and complain that there isn't enough.	Sometimes there are people who don’t have enough food at home.
わかりました、気をつけます。	I understand and will be careful.	I understand, be careful.
ご飯が盛れたらこの湯煎されたレトルトの具をご飯の上に載せてください。	After the rice, put this heated the boil-in-the-bag ingredient onto the rice.	When the meal is filled, put the baked potato on the meal.
これは何のどんぶりを作っているんでしょうか？	What dish are we making?	What does this make?
中華丼ですね、うちのスーパーの人気商品です。	A Chinese donburi which is one of the most popular product at our supermarket.	Chinese rice is our super popular product.
載せました、これで良いでしょうか？	Here it is, is this good?	I posted it, can it be this?
これだと真ん中に具が固まっているのでご飯の上に均等に載るようにしてください。	The topping is all in the middle, make sure it's spread evenly over the rice.	This means that the piece is fixed in the middle, so make sure it is equally placed on the meal.
最後に右端に漬物を乗せたら蓋を閉じます。	Please place the pickles on the right side and then put a lid on it.	And when you put it on the right side, it will be closed.
これで完成でしょうか？	Is this done?	Will this be finished?
いいえ、商品シールを貼ります。	No, we still need to put the product sticker on.	No, I will put the product seal.
この中華弁当500円って書いたシールでしょうか？	"Is it this ""Chinese bento box 500 yen"" sticker?"	Do you want to write about the 500 yen Chinese meal?
いえ、これは中華弁当ではなくて中華丼です。	"No, this is a ""Chinese bowl"" not a ""Chinese bento box""."	This is not a Chinese meal, but a Chinese rice.
シールの貼り間違いが最近多く起きているので品名と値段はしっかり確認してください。	People have been applying the stickers inconsistently recently so please make sure that you're matching the stickers and food correctly.	There are many mistakes that have occurred recently, so check the name and price thoroughly.
わかりました、シールは容器のどのあたりに貼るって決まってるんですか？	I will be careful, is there a particular position for the stickers?	Do you know where the seal is placed around the container?
中身が見えるように、シールは邪魔にならない右端でお願いします。	Yes, always make sure the sticker is visible the right hand side.	As you can see inside, the seal will not interfere with the right edge.
これで出来上がりなので、出来上がったら売り場に並べます。	So as this is done, we bring it out to the counter.	I’m going to go out, so when I get out, I’m going to sell it.
並べる場所は決まってるんでしょうか？	Any place in particular?	Is there a place to arrange?
エビチリやチャーハンの並んでいる中華コーナーに並べてください。	Please place it with the rest of the Chinese food in the corner with the chili shrimps and fried rice.	Please arrange it to the Chinese corner on the side of Ebichili and Chahan.
中華コーナー内であればどこに並べても大丈夫ですよ。	Anywhere in that section should be fine.	Wherever you are in the Chinese corner, it’s okay.
作ったばかりの商品は同じ商品が並んでいれば後ろに並べた方がいいんですよね。	We just made this one so should it go to the back of the shelf?	If the goods you have just made are the same goods, it is better to put them on the back.
通常のスーパーなら先入先出なのでそうなると思います。	Normally, most supermarkets apply a first in first out system.	If you are a regular supervisor, I think that will be the first time.
うちのスーパーは作りたての新しいものを提供することで他と差別化しています。	We differentiate ourselves from other supermarkets by providing freshly made ones.	Our supermarkets are discriminating with others by offering something new that we have created.
なので新しいものは古いものより手前に並べてください。	Please place the newly made items in front of the older ones.	So put the new things in front of the old.
わかりました、並べてきました。	I understand, I went and placed it with the rest of them.	I realized, I got together.
では同じ中華丼をあと10個作ってください。	"OK then, please make 10 more of the same ""Chinese donburi""."	Make the same Chinese rice 10 more.
わかりました。	Alright.	I realized.
お疲れ様、田中さん。	How are you Tanaka-san.	Congratulations to you, Mr. Tango.
お疲れ様です、船越さん。	How are you Funakoshi-san.	Congratulations to you, Shipman.
あのさ、春季カタログの印刷締め切りを14日に繰り上げたいんだ。	By the way, I'd like to advance the publishing deadline for the spring catalog to the 14th.	I want to start the printing deadline for the spring catalogue on 14 days.
それまでに家具製品に関するページを仕上げれそう？	Do you think you can finish up the page in regards to the furniture products by then?	Can you finish a page about furniture products?
それは問題ないと思います。	I don't think that will be a problem.	I think that is no problem.
デザイン作業の大半は完了させてあります。	Most of the design is already done.	Most of the design work is completed.
でも、製品価格がまだ決定していなくて...。	But the price of the product isn't decided yet.	The price of the product has not yet been determined.
あ、岡田さん。	Oh, Okada-san.	Oh my Oka.
マーケティング部から最終版の製品価格表受け取りました？	Did you get the final version of the product price list from the marketing department?	Have you received the final product price list from the marketing department?
いや、まだですね。	No, not yet.	No, it is still.
昨日が提出期限でしたよね。	The submission deadline was yesterday, right?	It was a deadline yesterday.
でも、まだ連絡もらっていませんね。	Yet we haven't heard anything yet.	But you have not been contacted yet.
んー、マーケティング部の者に連絡しておくよ。	Hmm, I will contact someone from the marketing department.	Please contact the marketing department.
そしたら、田中さんがカタログを仕上げられるよね。	Then Tanaka-san will be able to finish the catalog, right?	And then Tandy can finish the catalogue.
はい、助かります。	Yes, that would be great.	Yes, I will help.
うん、カタログは我々の最優先事項だからね。	Yeah, the catalog is our top priority.	Yes, because catalogue is our top priority.
そうですね。	Yeah.	Yes is.

うん、また連絡するよ。	Yeah, I'll contact you later.	Yes, I will contact you again.

概略を理解するには十分でしたよ。	It was enough to get a general understanding.	It was enough to understand the summary.
でも、ちょっと具体的に経営陣に話を進めるとなると、少々心もとなくて。	But I'm not that confident when it comes to actually proceeding with discussions with the management team.	But if you’re going to talk a little bit specifically to the management, it’s a little bit hard.
電話で相談するには際どい内容ですから、直接お会いできませんか？	The content is pretty tricky to discuss over the phone so would it be possible to meet in person?	It’s a good thing to talk to you on the phone, can I see you directly?
構わないよ。	That's fine.	It doesn’t matter.
急で恐縮ですが、今週中にどこかお時間いただけませんか？	Apologies for the sudden request but could you give me some of your time sometimes this week?	Sorry, but can you get some time this week?

時期が時期だし、インフルエンザに罹った？	You know it's the flu season, do you think you came down with it?	Is it time for you to get influenza?

みんな、輸出へのプランを考えてきてくれましたか？	Did everyone think about an exporting plan?	Have you thought of an export plan?
考えてきたんですが、初めてのことなので中々難しかったです。	I did think about it but it was pretty hard as it was my first time.	I thought it was the first time, but it was hard.
では、小宮君からお願いしてもいいですか？	Okay, can we start with you, Komiya-kun?	Can I ask you for a little bit?
はい、分かりました。	Yes, okay.	Yes, I understand it.
僕はやはり初回の実験的な輸出であるということから、シンガポールに住む日本人をターゲットとした今日本で販売している商品の輸出が良いのではないかと思います。	I still think the first trial export should target Japanese people living in Singapore and export the products we sell in Japan today would be good.	Since I am the first experimental export, I think it is good to export the goods that are now sold in Japan, targeting Japanese people living in Singapore.
なるほど。	I see.	So much.
日本人をターゲットにするということで、今ある既存の商品をそのまま輸出することができます。	By targeting Japanese people, we can simply export the existing products that we have.	In order to target the Japanese, we can continue to export existing goods.
現地の日本人が集まりやすい場所に販売箇所を絞ることで、経費も削減できると考えます。	If we narrow down our sales point to places where Japanese people tend to gather in the local area, we should be able to reduce our expenses too.	I believe that by reducing sales points in locations where local Japanese people are easily gathered, the cost can also be reduced.
私も小宮さんの意見に賛成です。	I agree with Komiya-san's idea.	I also agree with the point of view of Modi.
村田さんの案も聞かせてもらえますか？	Can you tell us about your idea too, Murata-san?	Can I tell you the proposal of Madonna?
私もまずは現地に住んでいる日本人をターゲットにしてみてはどうかと思います。	I think we should first target Japanese people living locally as well.	I would like to try to target the Japanese people who live in the area.
狭い国なので、日本人がよく行くスーパーに協力してもらって販売するのが一番現実的かと思います。	It's a small country so I think if we can get supermarkets where Japanese people go often to cooperate with us and sell through there will be the most realistic.	As a small country, I think it is the most realist to get the supermarkets to cooperate and sell.
佐藤部長、質問です。	Sato-san, I have a question.	Mr Sato, I have a question.
小林君、どうしましたか？	What is it, Kobayashi-kun.	Mr. Lin, what did you do?
このチームはまだただの有志の集まりで正式なチームではないと思うのですが、予算はありますか？	This team is still formed with volunteers and is not an official team but do we have a budget?	I think this team is not just an intentional meeting and an official team yet, do you have a budget?
今後の方向性次第で社長と総務に直談判する形になると思います。	I think it will depend on the direction we take from now and have the president and the general affairs department decide.	Depending on the direction, I think it will be a way to negotiate with the President and the General Assembly.
でしたら、実際に自分たちがシンガポールに行って、現地調査を兼ねたサンプル配布を行うことは可能でしょうか？	If that is the case, will it be possible for us to go to Singapore and do field research as well as distributing samples?	If so, is it really possible that we go to Singapore and distribute samples with local research?
現地でどの様なものが売れているのか、今後の参考にしたいですし、日本人以外にもサンプルを直接配ることで現地の生の声が聞いてみたいです。	I'd like to learn about what kind of things are sold locally for future reference, and listen to the actual comments of locals by distributing samples directly to non-Japanese people.	I would like to refer to what kind of thing is sold in the local area, and I would like to hear the local live voice by distributing the samples directly in addition to the Japanese.
それはいい考えですね、私も賛成です。	That's a good idea, I'm in favor of that.	This is a good idea, I agree with it too.
僕も賛成です。	I'm in favor of that too.	I also agree.
なるほど、私もいい考えだと思います。	I see, I think that's a good idea as well.	Yes, I think it is a good idea too.
では、このプランをベースに社長と総務を納得させることができるような計画を立てましょう。	Okay, let's use this plan as a base and form a plan that can convince the president and the general affairs department.	So let us make a plan that can convince the President and the General Assembly on the basis of this plan.

新幹線代は大きいもんね。	Shinkansen fare isn't cheap.	The new line is big.
領収書をなくした場合は、こっちの書類を記入してもらう必要があるの。	In case of a lost receipt, this different form needs to be filled out.	If you have lost the receipt, you need to fill out the documents.

お願いします。	Please do that for me.	Please please.

ごめんね、領収書を切ってもらった日のM銀行のレートで計算してもらってもいいかな？	Sorry, can you calculate it using the M bank's rate on the day you got your receipt?	Sorry, can I calculate the bank’s rate on the day I received the receipt?
分かりました。	Yes sir.	I understood.
それ以外は問題なさそうだから、その2点だけ訂正お願いします。	Everything looks great other than that, so please fix those two things.	There is no problem, so please correct the two.

それで、できるだけ早く迎えに来て下さい、ということで...。	Is it alright if I leave work early?	So let me come to you as soon as possible...
この忙しい時期にすみません。	I apologize for asking for such a favor at a busy time.	Sorry for this busy time.
早退させていただけますか。	I would like to pick my child up as soon as possible.	Can you give me back early?

日報ももう入力済みです。	I've also finished filling out the daily report.	The newspaper has already entered.
わかりました。	Alright then.	I realized.
もしインフルエンザとかだったら、しばらくお休みになるかもしれないですよね。	Perhaps you'll have to take a break from work if your child has the flu.	If you have flu, you may have a while of vacation.
そうですね。	I might have to if that's the case.	Yes is.
でも、まだ保育園ではインフルエンザの話を聞かないので、大丈夫だとは思うんですが...。	But I haven't heard any outbreak of the flu at the nursery, so I think it might be fine.	But I don’t know about the flu in the garden yet, so I think it’s okay.
まさかのインフルエンザだった場合は、とりあえず明日はお休みさせていただきます。	If ever my child does have the flu, then I'll have to take the day off tomorrow.	If you have flu, I will leave you tomorrow.

それが全部、商談のための諸費用としてのなの。	He says they are for the company meetings.	All of this is the cost of negotiation.
上田さん、そんなに忙しくしてたっけ？	Has he been so busy these days?	Yuri, did you be so busy?
私が見る限り、そうだとは思わなかったんだけど。	I didn't think he was so busy as far as I know.	As far as I saw, I didn’t think that was so.
週末は、必ず商談のためと言って、レストランの領収書持ってくるのよ。	He gives me a restaurant receipt every weekend regularly, saying it's for a company meeting.	At the end of the weekend, you will always have a restaurant receipt.

そうよ、もしその領収書が私用で使われたものだとしたら、とんでもないことだもの。	Yes, it'll be so wrong if the receipts were for private use.	Yes, if the receipt was used for private purposes, it’s unfortunate.

会社でフードドネーションを募るというのはどうでしょうか？	How about making a food donation as a company.	What about seeking a donation in the company?
普段は仕事で忙しいので、どこかに行くというのは難しいと思います。	As we are all busy working, it's not easy to be away.	I’m usually busy with work, so it’s hard to go somewhere.
会社に大きな箱を設けて、使わない缶詰や、保存食を持って来て入れてもらう。	So we could put a large box and ask the employees to bring in some unwanted tinned or preserved food.	Install a large box to the company and bring us unused containers or stored food.
これなら負担なくできるのでは？	I don't think it would cause much trouble.	Can this be done without a burden?
それはいい考えだと思います。	That's a good idea.	I think that is a good idea.
以前、子供の学校でその様なフードドネーションウィークがありました。	My kid's school had a food donation week before.	Previously there was such a food donation week at children’s school.
かなりの数が集まったと聞きしたよ。	I heard they collected loads of donation.	I heard that a lot of people were gathered.

うちもですよ。	So do I.	It is our too.
もしもの時用に買っていて、全然使っていませんでした。	I stocked up some for the emergency, but forgot to use them up.	If I bought it for time, I did not use it at all.
きっと社内でも、その様な人がたくさんいるでしょうね。	Maybe more people in our office are similar.	There will probably be a lot of people like that in the company.
そうだ。	Oh!	Yes is.
もう着れなくなった衣類も持って来てもらったらどうでしょう。	How about asking everybody to bring along the old clothes as well?	What if you get out of clothes that you can’t wear?
特に、子供服は助かると思います。	Particularly, children's clothing is in demand.	Especially children’s clothes can help.
賛成！	Agree!	I agree!
子供服は、すぐサイズが着れなくなってしまうし。	Kids quickly grow out of the clothes.	The children’s clothes are not in size.
喜んでもらえることは、間違いないと思います。	So, I'm sure kids' clothes will be well accepted.	I am sure you will be happy.
そうしましょう。	Okay, then we'll do.	Let us do it.
では、社内でドネーションを募るという事に決まりですね。	So, we've agreed to ask donation of food and clothing internally.	So you want to get donations within the company.

助かります。	Thanks.	I will help.
たくさん集まるといいですね。	I hope we will have a lot of donation.	I hope you will gather a lot.

ただ東京出張でも時間が沢山あったほうがいいので午後早めの便がいいかな。	But it would be better if I have more time for the business trip to Tokyo so maybe an earlier flight in the afternoon would be good.	It is better to have a lot of time on a trip to Tokyo, so you can get a flight early in the afternoon.
うーん、ANAの午後便で今見たところ1番早い空席が17時発ですね。	Hmm, I just checked the flight for Airline A and the earliest available flight is from 5 o'clock.	Yes, the fastest vacancy that I have seen at ANA's afternoon flight is at 17 p.m.
そんなに埋まっているのかい？	Is it that full?	Are you so buried?
残念ですがそのようですね。	Unfortunately yes.	Sorry, but it looks like that.
JALでも見てみましょうか？	Should I take a look at Airline B?	Let me look at JAL?
頼むよ、17時は流石に遅すぎる。	Yes, please, 5 o'clock is a bit too late.	Please, we are too late at 17 p.m.
お待たせしました、JALでもこの日は夕方まで満席ですね。	Thank you for waiting, it seems Airline B is fully booked until the evening.	I have been waiting for you, but this day is full until the evening.
何かイベントでもあるんでしょうかね。	I wonder if there is some event or something.	Is there any event?
困ったなあ、LCCとかでもないかな？	That's no good, is there any with the LCC?	Do you have any problems with LCC?
LCC便ですね、お待ちください。	LCC flights, let me check.	The LCC flight, please wait.
やっぱりありませんね、新幹線はどうなんですか？	No there aren't any, how about the bullet train?	I don’t know, what about the new line?
新幹線は不便だからあまり好きではないんだよな。	The bullet train isn't convenient so I'm actually not fond of it.	The new line is uncomfortable, so I don't like it.
そうはいってもこの場合仕方ないんではありませんか？	Yeah, but what else can we do?	Is it not possible in this case?
うーん、先方に連絡して商談は後日にしてもらうよ。	Hmm, I'll call the person I'm meeting and will ask to shift the business meeting to a later date.	I’ll contact you first and I’ll talk to you later.
なので予約はこのままで大丈夫。	So you can leave the reservation as is.	The reservation is okay.
承知しました。	Understood.	I realized.
それとあと一つ頼んでいいかな？	And can I ask you to do one more thing?	Can I ask for another thing?
はい、なんでしょうか？	Yes, what is it?	Yes, what is it?
明日の東京でのホテルなんだけど予約確認メール見たら喫煙ルームになってるんだよ。	It's in regards to the hotel in Tokyo tomorrow, I was looking at the confirmation email and noticed that it was a smoking room.	Tomorrow’s hotel in Tokyo, but if you see the booking confirmation email, you’ll be a smoking room.
俺が自分で予約した時にミスったんだと思う。	I must have made a mistake when I booked it.	I think I made a mistake when I booked myself.
ホテルに連絡して、禁煙ルームが空いてるなら部屋変更を頼んどいてもらえないかな？	Can you call the hotel and ask if there are non-smoking rooms available, and if so can you change the room?	Please contact the hotel and if there is no smoking room, can I change the room?
わかりました、どこのホテルでしょうか？	Okay, which hotel is it?	I know which hotel is it?
銀座のNホテルだ。	It's Hotel N in Ginza.	The N hotel in Ginseng.
わかりました。	Okay.	I realized.
ちょっと携帯の充電が切れそうなのでどうなったかメール送っておいてくれる？	My battery on my phone is running low so can you send me an email on what you find out?	I'm going to get off the phone and what happens to send me an email?
はい、それでは失礼します。	Okay, I'll get back to you on this.	Yes, then I apologize.
緑川さんお疲れ様！	Midorikawa-san, how are you!	Good luck green!
明日営業部は新入社員歓迎会なんでしょ、たくさん楽しんでおいでね。	So tomorrow is the sales department's new employee welcoming party, go have lots of fun.	Tomorrow will be a new business meeting, and you can enjoy it.
私楽しみな反面ちょっと憂鬱なんですよね。	I look forward to it but I'm also a bit depressed.	I am a bit depressed, right?
なんでどうしたの、何か心配事でもあるの？	What's wrong, are you worried about something?	Why is it happening, you are worried about something?
なんか学生時代のサークルの飲み会とは違うんで粗相をしたらどうしようって。	It will be different from a drinking party from a club in my university days so I'm worried I will get out of line.	What if you do not drink from a student’s cycle, what if you do?
そんなこと心配してたの？	You were worried about something like that?	Was you worried about that?
歓迎への感謝の気持ちを表して普通にいつもどおり楽しく過ごせばいいと思うわよ。	I think you can just express your gratitude to the party and just enjoy it normally as usual.	I would like to be grateful for your welcome and enjoy it as usual.
いつもどおりってそんなことだけでいいんですか？	Normally as usual, that's all?	Should you just do that as usual?
歓迎会ってみんなで仲良くするものでしょ、それにお互い知り合うものでもある。	You're supposed to have fun with everyone at welcoming parties, it's also to learn more about each other.	They are welcome to each other, and they are well known to each other.
あんまりよそよそしかったりギクシャクしててもおかしな印象を持たれるだけよ。	They will have a weird impression of you if you are too uptight and awkward about it.	If you’re so crazy or crazy, you’ll have a strange impression.
そんなものなんですねー、普通が1番ってことですね。	So just like that, being normal is the best, right?	That’s the best thing, that’s the most normal thing.
なにか飲み会で新入社員がやらないといけないことってありますか？	Is there anything that a new employee must do at drinking parties?	Do you have anything to do for a new employee to drink?
そうねー、気遣いができればいいんじゃないかしら？	Well, it would be good if you are attentive.	No, do you need to be worried?
例えば取り皿が足りない人はいないかとか、お酒がまだ来てない人がいないかとか。	Like making sure everyone has an extra plate or making sure everyone has got their alcohol.	For example, there are people who don’t have enough dishes or there are people who don’t have enough drinks yet.
グラスのお酒が減ってきたら足してあげるとか。	Pouring some alcohol in their glass if it's getting less.	If you drink a glass, do you add it?
あれってどれぐらいになったら注げばいいんですか？	When should I be pouring it?	How long should I put it in?
3分の1とかですか？	Like one third?	Is it a third?
それとも完全にグラスが空になってからですか？	Or when the glass is completely empty?	Or when the glass is completely empty?
これ人によって好みがいろいろなのよね、私は空になってから派だけど。	People preferences varies but I'm the type that does it when it is empty.	I have a lot of people like it, but I have been free.
特にどれぐらいっていうのはないのよね。	There isn't really a set amount.	Especially not how much.
1回3分の1ぐらいになった時に注いでみればわかるんじゃない？	You will probably know if you try pouring it once when it is around one third.	If you’re about one-third, you’ll know.
嫌な人なら断るだろうし、そうじゃない人はそのままグラスを差し出すわよ。	People who dislike it will say no and those who are fine will just hand you their glass.	Whoever is bad will refuse, and whoever is not, will offer a glass.
でもそこまで細かくグラスに目を光らせなくても気づいた時に注げばいいわよ。	But I don't think you have to be that detailed and attentive, just pour it when you notice it.	But it should be so detailed when you don’t see the glass.
なるほど、わかりました。	I see, got it.	Well, I realized it.
やっぱり部長とか課長の席には率先してお酒を注ぎに行ったほうがいいんでしょうか？	Should I be pouring alcohol to managers or the section chief?	Would you like to go to the chairman or to the chairman’s seat and drink?
まあ1回くらいは行ったほうがいいわね。	I think it would be good to go at least once.	It is better to go about one time.
偉い人から順番に回るんですよね？	So I should go around in order in terms of rank?	You’re going to be a great man, right?
そうね、基本は序列順ね。	Yeah, by rank in general.	Basically, it is a sequence.
明日の会場はどこなの？	Where is the venue tomorrow?	Where is the meeting tomorrow?
S駅の側のHホテルの宴会場って聞いてます。	I heard it is at the banquet hall of Hotel H beside Station S.	I hear the party room of the H hotel on the side of the S station.
だったら丸テーブルで6名ずつぐらいで座ると思うわ。	Then I think there will be around 6 people sitting around a round table.	I think it will be about six people sitting on a whole table.
課長と同じ席になったらそこは序列気にせず課長のを先に注げばいいわ。	If the section chief is sitting with you then you can ignore the rank and just pour it for the section chief first.	If you are in the same position as the chief, you should not be in line with the chief first.
それとあそこだとフレンチのコースだから周りのペースに合わせて食べてね。	Also, they serve a French course menu so make sure to eat at a pace that others are eating at.	It’s a French course, so you can eat around.
妙に遅かったり早かったりするとマイペースだなって捉えられかねないから。	If you are oddly slow or fast, they may think you are the type that does things at your own pace.	If it’s too late or too early, you can see it as a myth.
わかりました、私男兄弟の中で育って食べるのが早いんですけど気をつけます。	Okay, I grew up with older and younger brothers so I eat fast but I will be careful.	I know I’m going to grow up in my brothers and sisters quickly, but I’m careful.
最後にくれぐれもこれだけは覚えておいて。	Finally, be sure to remember this by all means.	Finally, remember this only.
新入社員歓迎会だけではなくて今後会社の飲み会では酔っ払いすぎないこと。	Be sure to not get too drunk not just for new employee welcome party but for future company drinking parties.	Not only the new employees welcome, but also not too drunk in the company’s future drinking meetings.
酔っ払いすぎると自分が気づかないうちに変わってしまう人もいるから。	There are people who completely change without realizing when they get too drunk.	Some people get too drunk until they realize that they’re changing.
はい、アドバイスありがとうございます。	Okay, thank you for your advice.	Thank you for the advice.
でもあそこの伊勢海老のクリームソースは最高よ、楽しんできてね！	But their lobster cream sauce is awesome, have fun!	But there is the greatest ice cream, enjoy it!
これはこれは谷中先生、いつもお世話になってます。	Hello Yanaka san, it's a pleasure, as always.	This is what Mr. Walton always takes care of.
社長、こちらこそいつもお世話になっております。	Hello Miyajima san, the pleasure is all mine.	President, I’m always taking care of you.
今日は健康診断についてちょっとお話ししたかったものでお伺いしました。	Today, I wanted to discuss the health examination situation with you.	I wanted to talk a little about my health diagnosis today.
そうか、社員に健康診断を受けさせないといけないんだよね。	Oh yes, we need to provide medical examinations for our employees.	You need to get a health diagnosis to your employees.
そうなんですよ、これは労働安全衛生法で義務付けられているんです。	That's right, it is mandated by the Labor Safety and Health Act.	Yes, this is required by the Labour Safety and Health Act.
長時間労働での健康障害が増えてるので、かなり厳しくなっていますね。	It's very strict now that there's been an increase in health disorders due to long working hours.	The number of health disorders on long hours of work is increasing, so it is quite severe.
よしわかった、やろう。	Alright, then we must get this in order.	I understand, I will do it.
会社指定の病院で受けさせればいいんだっけ？	Do we send them to one of the company approved hospitals?	Should you get it to the company’s appointed hospital?
それもひとつの方法としてありますね。	That is one option.	There is also one way.
あとは、会社で集団健診を実施か従業員各自に受診させてその結果を提出させるかです。	Or the company can organize a group health examination, or allow each employee to take an exam and submit results.	Afterwards, the company will conduct a collective health care or the employees will consult themselves and submit the results.
いろいろあるんだね、うちはどれがいいんだろうか？	I see, there are many options, which would you recommend?	There’s a lot of things, which one is better?
御社であれば、加入してあるG県健保組合の指定医療機関での受診が望ましいですね。	I recommend using one of the G prefectural health insurance association approved medical institutions for your company.	If you are the company, you will be advised to attend the appointed medical institution of the G Prefecture Health Association.
一番手間がかからずにできる方法です。	That would be the easiest option.	It is the hardest way to do it.
それって健保組合の指定した医療機関じゃないとダメなのかい？	Would it have to be a medical institution approved by the health insurance association?	Is it not a healthcare institution that has been appointed by the healthcare association?
そうですね、原則そうなります。	As a general rule, yes.	Yes, the principle is that.
実はうちのクライアントにL病院があってね。	We have an L hospital as our client.	In fact, my client has a hospital.
できたらそこで受けさせたらいいんじゃないかと思ったわけよ。	I was hoping we can use the hospital, if possible.	I thought I would like you to get it there if you could.
今リストを持っていますので調べてみます。	Let's see, I will check the list right now.	I have a list now, I will check it out.
うーん、L病院ですね。	Well, L hospital is...	The L Hospital.
残念ながらリストには入っていないようですね。	Unfortunately is not on the list.	Unfortunately, it does not appear to be on the list.
そうか、ここで受けさせるにはどうしたらいいかな？	Hum, how can we use this hospital?	So what can I do to get it here?
この健康診断は会社が全ての費用を負担しないといけません。	The company would have to cover the costs for the health examinations.	This health diagnosis must be charged by the company for all costs.
なので私がL病院に事前に話をして社員さんから費用徴取をしないように伝えます。	I can contact L hospital and tell them not to charge the fees from the employees ahead of time.	So I'll talk to the hospital in advance and tell you not to charge the staff.
ただ各自に受診させるので健康診断の必要項目以外を受診希望することもあります。	There might be incidences where they might request something other than what's required when the exams are done individually.	It is possible for each person to receive a medical examination, in addition to the necessary medical examination.
例えばどういうケース？	Can you give me an example?	For example, what case?
バリウムではなく胃カメラ検査を希望したりするケースですね。	For example, in a case when an employee chooses a gastroscopy procedure, rather than taking barium.	You want to check the stomach camera instead of the valve.
この差額でプラス2万円になったりすることもあります。	The cost difference will be an additional 20,000 yen.	This difference can also be up to 20,000.
なるほどね。	I see.	Well as well.
その場合はオプションになることを事前に社員さんに伝えておく必要があります。	We would need to inform the employees in advance that there are different options.	In this case, you need to inform the employee prior to being an option.
私の方で、健康診断のお知らせのようなものを作りましょう。	I will draw up a memo for the health exam.	Let me make something like a health diagnosis.
よろしく、頼んだよ。	That would be great, thank you.	Welcome, I asked you.
受ける時期は皆一緒じゃないといけないのかい？	Would we need to get all of them to take the exam around the same time?	Should we all have time to get together?
なかなか現場の都合もあって、皆一緒には難しいと思うんだよね。	I think it will be difficult for all of them to go around the same time due to site constraints.	It’s a good place, and you think it’s hard to get together.
それは構いませんよ、皆さんで揃えなくても問題ありません。	I  agree and  they won't need to do it at the same time.	It doesn’t matter, you don’t have any problem.
それとこれは法律上、受診時間中の賃金支払い義務はありません。	Also, it is not required by law to pay employees during the examination.	And this is legally not obligatory to pay the salary during the receipt time.
ただし、労働時間として取り扱い、賃金を支払うことが望ましいとされています。	But it is recommended that the company treat that time as work, and provide pay.	However, it is desirable to be treated as working hours and pay the salary.
社員からすれば、会社からの命令で健康診断に行くという形になりますので。	Most employees consider it as a company requirement that they do the exam.	The employee will be given an order from the company for a health diagnosis.
わかった、勤務時間扱いにしよう。	I understand, we will treat it as working hours.	I know, I’m going to deal with working hours.
では私は健康診断のお知らせができましたらまたご連絡します。	OK, I will let you know when I prepare the memo for the health exam.	If I have a medical diagnosis, I will contact you again.
ご苦労さん、よろしく頼むよ。	That would be great, thank you.	Thank you very much, please.
新人だからってどうして電話を率先して取らなくちゃいけないんですか？	Just because we're new, why do we have to take the initiative in picking up calls?	Why do you need to be a new phone?
手が空いている人が取ればいいだけじゃないですか。	Why can't whoever is available pick it up?	Do you want to take someone with empty hands?
確かにそうですね。	That's true.	Surely that is.
でも率先して電話を出る事によって先様に新しい人が入ったんだなと名前を覚えてもらえます。	But if you take the initiative and pick up, it will be a chance for the other party to know that a new person joined and to remember your name.	But you can remember the name of a new person before calling out.
そして電話対応が良いとあなたの評価が回りまわって社外からも社内からも上がります。	And if the way you handled the call was good, your reputation will get better from outside and inside the company.	And if the phone responds well, your rating will rise from outside and from within the company.
おお、それはいいですね。	Oh, that'd be nice.	Oh, that is good.
ということで、電話対応お願いしますね。	So, please do pick up the calls.	Please respond to the phone.
ではどうして僕たちが資料集めや必要な情報の選定をしなくてはいけないんですか？	Then why is it that we have to gather reference materials and pick out information?	So why do we need to collect and select the necessary information?
これは作家先生本人がするべきことですよね？	Isn't this something that the author should do?	This is what the writer should do, right?
そうですね、アマチュアの作家さんはもちろんプロの作家先生でも自分でされる方はおられます。	Well, there are amateur authors and of course professional authors who do it themselves.	Yes, the amateur writer can, of course, be a professional writer.
でも私は作家先生に今目の前にある物語に集中してほしい。	But I want the author to focus on the story in front of them now.	But I want the writer to focus on the story that is in front of me.
資料集めは地味に時間がかかるものです。	Gathering reference materials does take some time to do.	The collection of documents takes time.
だからその時間を執筆に使ってほしいと、私は思っています。	So, I'd rather have the author spend that time writing.	So I want to spend that time writing.
それに違う目線で資料を集め選定することは、作家先生の想像力を刺激する事にも繋がります。	Also, gathering materials and picking out the information from a different perspective can bring about a new idea for the author too.	Moreover, collecting and choosing materials from a different perspective will also stimulate the writer’s imagination.
ただ資料を集めるだけじゃないんです。	So it's not just simply gathering materials.	It’s not just collecting documents.
そういった事も編集者の仕事だと、私は考えています。	I believe that things like that are part of an editor's job.	I think that’s the job of the editor.
なるほど、そういう意味もあるんですね。	I see, there is such a meaning behind that too.	Yes, it also means that.
ありがとうございます、佐々木さん。	Thank you very much Sasaki-san.	Thank you, Mr. Sasuke.
木檜さん、おはようございます！	Good morning, Satoru!	Good Morning Mr. Moore!
おお、ピーターソンさん、朝から随分元気だね。	Hi, Ron, you're pretty hyper today.	Mr. Peterson, you’re well in the morning.
なんかあったの？	What's up?	Has something happened?
今度ウチの生体認証センサーがテレビに出るって知ってる？	Have you heard that our biometric sensor will be on TV soon?	Do you know that our bio-recognition sensors will be on television?
ああ、なんかそんな事誰かが言ってたっけ。	Ah, I've heard someone was saying something about that, I guess.	Oh, something that someone said.
木曜夜にやってるT放送のニュース番組に出るんだ。	We'll be on the news show for T Station every Thursday night.	I'm going to get to the news show on Thursday night.
あの番組の中で「今週の最先端技術」って紹介するコーナーあるじゃない？	"You know ""State of the Art Technology of the Week"" section in that show, don't you?"	There’s a corner in that program that’s presenting “the most advanced technology” this week, right?
あ、それ私も結構見てますよ！	Oh, I watch that quite often, too!	Oh, I’m watching it too much!
ああ、そういえばこの間、AI使ったサイバー攻撃防御システムとかってF株式会社が取り上げられてたな。	Oh, yeah, F Corporation was on that show the other day, showing their cyber security system that uses AI or something.	Oh, that’s, for example, the AI used cyber-attack defense system for the past time.
そうね、あの時出てたFの人、話が上手かったわ。	That's right, that person from F was pretty good at talking.	Yes, the people who came out at that time were good to talk.
実はあのコーナーって、一発撮りなんだって。	I've heard that section is actually shot in one go.	In fact, that corner is a shot.
えー、でも結構突っ込んだ質問とかしてくるよね？	Wow, but they often ask some sharp questions, don't they?	Yes, but you’re getting a lot of questions, right?
この研究所って、機密保持契約のプロジェクト多いから何言うか気を付けないとだね。	This laboratory has quite a few of projects with non-disclosure agreement, so we have to be careful what we say, huh?	This laboratory has a lot of confidentiality contracts, so you have to be careful about what you say.
ウチのラボからは誰が出るの？	Who's going to be on the show from our lab?	Who comes out of our laboratory?
多分長澤さんじゃないかな。	I guess Kaname would be the one.	Per it’s Nagoya.
彼、開発部長だし。	He's our Chief of the Development, too.	He is the Development Director.
あのセンサーの事一番良く知ってるでしょ。	And he knows everything about our sensor.	You know the best of that sensor.
彼なら安心してテレビの前に座ってられるね。	Then I can relax in front of the TV if he'll be on air.	He can be calm and sitting in front of the TV.
あ、噂をすれば...。	Oh, speaking of the devil...	If you have rumors...
長澤さん、おはようございます！	Good morning, Kaname!	Mr. Nagoya, good morning!
おはよう。	Good morning.	Good Morning.
みんな朝から集まって何の話？	What are you all chatting about gathering together?	What do you talk about in the morning?
私は仲間はずれなのかな？	Am I missing on something here guys?	I am a friend away, right?
いえ長澤さん、ウチのセンサーがテレビで紹介されるって話をしてたんです。	Well, we were just talking about our sensor being introduced on TV, Kaname.	No, Mr. Nagoya, I told you that our sensor will be presented on TV.
ああ、あれか、みんな耳が早いね。	Oh, that, you guys have sharp ears, huh?	Everyone has a quick ear.
長澤さん、それっていつ放送されるんですか？	When is it going to be on air, Kaname?	Mr. Nagoya, when will it be broadcast?
うーん、３週間くらい先のオンエアだったかな。	I think it'll be on about three weeks from now.	It was an on-line three weeks ago.
もう撮ったんですか？	Have they shot already?	Have you already photographed?
いや、来週火曜日の午後のはずだ。	Not yet, it's supposed to be next Tuesday afternoon.	No, it should be Tuesday afternoon.
テレビ局の撮影班がここに来るよ。	A camera crew is coming here from the TV station.	The TV show is coming here.
うわー、何処で撮るんですか？	Wow, where are they shooting?	Oh, where do you take a picture?
第一会議室だと思うよ。	I believe they'll shoot it in Meeting Room 1.	I think it is the first meeting room.
先方がなるべく広くて明るい部屋がいい、って言ってたからね。	They said they'd prefer a spacious room with lots of light.	He said that the room should be as wide and bright as possible.
じゃあ、ボードとか少し片付けた方がいいですか？	Well then, should we put away some of the stuff like the whiteboard in the room?	Would you like to clean the board or a bit?
大丈夫だよ、いつも通りが良いらしいから。	It's okay, they want to shoot in our usual setting.	It’s okay, because it’s always good.
散らかってる研究室じゃなくて良かったね。	I'm relieved that they won't go into the messy lab.	Fortunately it wasn’t a laboratory.
あー、なんでよりによってその日なんだ、僕出張なのにー！	Argh, why does it have to be on that day, I'll be gone on a business trip!	Oh, why it's more than that day, I'm traveling!
ピーターソンさん、撮影関係ないでしょ。	You have nothing to do with shooting, though.	Mr. Peterson, it has nothing to do with filming.
だって、あのレポーターの女の子、ファンなんだよ！	Well, I'm a fan of that reporter girl!	The girl of the reporter is a fan.
お喋りしたいのは分かるけど、みんなあと10分で朝ミーティング、始めるよ。	I know you want to chat a bit more, but we have a morning meeting in 10 minutes, all right?	I know I want to talk to you, but everyone will start a meeting in 10 minutes.
じゃ、今朝のミーティングはこれくらいかな？	Well, so that's about it for the morning meeting today?	Is this the meeting this morning?
あ、あと１点だけ、確認させてください。	Oh, I'd like to confirm one more thing.	Just 1 point, please check it.
来週のテレビ取材ですけど、どのセンサー出すんですか？	About the TV coverage next week, which sensor are we showing them?	I'm going to get a TV interview next week, but what sensors are you going to get?
社長は最新のやつ出したがったんだけど...。	Well, Kentaro wanted to put out the latest ones, but....	The president wanted to get the latest...
静脈認証のはまだテスト完全に終わってないですよ？	We haven't completed testing for the one with vein authentication yet, you know?	The test is not completed yet, right?
ウチの３D顔認証の方はまだ開発中だし。	We're still developing 3D sensors for face recognition, too.	Our 3D face recognition is still in development.
だから、今F社のSフォンに乗せてる虹彩認証センサーを見せる事にしたんだよ。	So, we've decided to show our iris authentication sensor currently mounted on F Corporation's S phone.	So now I have to show you the rainbow certification sensor on the F company’s Sphone.
最新のセンサーに関しては、ちょっと最後に話入れるくらいが安全かなって。	As for our latest sensors, it's probably safer to mention a little at the end of the coverage.	As for the latest sensors, it’s safe to talk about the last one.
ふー、あの指紋認証の時みたいになったらって、心配してたんです。	Phew, I was worried if something went wrong like that time with that fingerprint sensor.	I was worried that it would be the time of fingerprinting.
私はまだトラウマですよ。	I still carry that trauma, you know?	I am still traumatic.
あーあれはヤバかった、生放送の番組だったしね。	Oh, that was chilling, and it was a live show, too!	It was bad, it was a live broadcast.
私、何の話か分からないんですけど。	I don't know what you guys are talking about.	I don't know what I am talking about.
指紋認証、ですか？	About fingerprint authentication?	Is it fingerprint?
ああ、かなり前の話だから三居さんはまだ居なかったかも。	Oh, yeah, it was quite a while ago so maybe you weren't around then, Anna.	Well, it was a long time ago, and the three might not be there yet.
10年くらい前でしたっけ？	About 10 years ago, I believe?	Was it about 10 years ago?
そう、当時ウチが開発したばかりの指紋認証センサー、今回みたいなテレビ番組が取り上げられたんだけど。	Yes, like this time, a TV show covered our fingerprint recognition sensor which we had just developed at the time.	Yes, the fingerprint recognition sensor we just developed at that time, a television show like this was taken over.
残念ながら、生放送の取材中にちゃんと作動しなくてね、その場でフォローも出来なくて。	Unfortunately, it didn't work out properly during the live report, and we couldn't cover for the trouble on the fly either.	Unfortunately, it doesn’t work properly during the live broadcast interview, and you can’t follow it.
そう、それでこの研究所の評判ガタ落ちして、回復すんのに数年かかったんだ！	Yeah, this lab's reputation took a nosedive then, and we had to spend few years to recover!	Yes, so this laboratory’s reputation has fallen down and it took a few years to recover!
あの時も大塚社長が一番新しいの出したいって言ったんだよね。	Kentaro insisted that he'd show the latest product at the time as well.	At that time, the president said he wanted the newest.
今回と違って、説得しきれなくて。	Unlike this time, I couldn't convince him not to.	Unlike this time, I can’t convince you.
でも、あれは田淵所長がセンサーの使い方も良く知らないのに色々触りまくってたのが大きな要因だよね。	But I think the big part of it was that Toru fiddled around with the sensor, even though he didn't know much about how to use it.	But that’s a big factor that Tanja Director didn’t know how to use the sensor well.
あの人、研究所所長っていっても、肩書きだけの元お役人でしょ？	He's the director of this laboratory, but just a figurehead, a retired official, isn't he?	He’s the director of the laboratory, but he’s only the title officer, right?
おいおい、言葉に気を付けなさいよ、ピーターソン君。	Whoa, you should watch your mouth, Ron.	Be careful with your words, Mr. Peterson.
だって真面目な話、田淵さん色々わかってないプロジェクトにいっつも口出して、迷惑かけるんですもん。	Well, seriously, he always intervenes in projects he doesn't really understands, and gets us into troubles.	Because it’s a serious story, Mr. Tanja, you don’t know a lot about the project, and you’re troubled.
先週だって僕のF社でのプレゼン見るって、ついて来たんですけど。	Last week too, Toru followed me to see my presentation at F Corporation, though.	Last week I saw the show at my F company.
いらん事ばっかり言うから、後から全部細々説明しなきゃいけなくて、スゴく余計な時間かかったんですよ。	He just kept telling them unnecessary things, so I had to spend so much extra time to follow up with explanations for each and every aspect.	I have to tell you all about it, and it took a lot of time to explain it.
あー、それ私も先月の展示会でやられたわー！	Oh, he did that to me, too, at an exhibition last month!	Oh, I did it in the exhibition last month too!
全部知ってるフリして来場者に話しちゃうでしょ？	He spoke to participants as if he knew everything, you know?	You know everything and you’re going to talk to the visitors, right?
ずっと気にして横からフォローいれなきゃいけなくて、ほんと疲れた!	I had to be on the watch and cover for him throughout the event, made me super exhausted!	I have to look after it all the time, I’m really tired!
表に出て話したいなら、もう少し勉強してからにして欲しいよねー。	He should learn more about our products if he wants to go speak in public.	If you want to talk to the table, then let me learn a little more.
まあまあ、みんなちょっと落ち着いて、そんなに彼を責めないで。	Well, everybody, calm down a bit, don't be so hard on him.	Be calm and don’t blame him so much.
田淵さんも今度はちゃんとやろうって考えているみたいだから、きっと大丈夫だよ。	Toru is thinking of how he'd do better this time, so he should be okay.	I think Mr. Tango is going to do it right now, so it’s okay.
え、ちょっと待ってください、大丈夫って何がですか？	Wait, wait a sec, what do you mean he'd be okay?	Wait a while, what’s okay?
あれ、さっき皆話してたでしょ？	Well, you were all talking about it, weren't you?	Everybody has talked about it before, right?
テレビに出るって、田淵さんが。	About Toru's appearance, on TV.	Going on TV, Mr. Tatiana.
まさか、今回の虹彩認証センサーも田淵所長が出るんじゃあないですよね？	You're not saying that Toru will be on the show this time with our iris recognition sensor, are you?	It’s not going to be the rainbow sensor that’s going to go out, right?
そうだよ、知らなかったの？	Yes, you didn't know?	Yes, did you not know?
いやいや、それは絶対無理ですって！	No, no, no, that's definitely impossible!	No, no, that’s not possible!
イヤだ、あんな悪夢はもう嫌だー！	No, way, no more of that nightmare!	I don’t like this nightmare anymore!
所長、今度はラボ全体をトラウマに陥れる気なんですか？	Is he trying to traumatize the whole Lab now?	Do you want to put the whole lab into a trauma?

それではこの新プロジェクトの概要について話します。	We are now going to talk about the outline of this project.	Then we will talk about the summary of this new project.
今回の新プロジェクトの狙いは我が社の新決済システムの新規利用先の開拓です。	The new project aims to identify new users for our payment settlement system.	The goal of this new project is to open up the new use of our company’s new payment system.
さらに、想定できる利用先とは異なる新しい利用者も獲得することが狙いです。	Furthermore, we are also looking at extending our services to new types of users from our list of sales leads.	In addition, it is intended to gain different new users than expected.
新しい利用者というと？	What exactly do you mean by new type of users?	A new user?
良いご質問ですね、通常の小売店や飲食店だけではなくその他にもということです。	Good question, it means we are aiming to attract not only retail shops or restaurants but also any other potential opportunities.	It’s a good question, not just the regular retail stores, food stores, and so on.
なるほど。	I see.	So much.
そうですか。	Ok.	Yes is?
様々な利用先を獲得したいということですね。	We want to get various type of users.	You want to get a variety of uses.
その通りです。	That's right.	It is right.
だからそれぞれ違う営業部署や担当からプロジェクトチームが構成されたんですね。	That's why our team comprises different sales departments and divisions.	Therefore, each project team was made up of different sales departments and responsibilities.
その通りです。	Exactly.	It is right.
各部署や各課での営業スタイルは違うと思いますが、それが強みになります。	Each department or unit has a different marketing strategy, and that would be our strength.	I think the style of sales in each department and department is different, but it will be strong.
そうですね。	Yes.	Yes is.
是非、このプロジェクトを成功させましょう。	Let's make this project a success.	Let us make this project successful.
はい、一緒に頑張りましょう！	Yes, let's try our best!	Yes, let’s work together!
もちろん数値目標があるのですが、その点については次回詳しく説明します。	Of course we will have a revenue target, but we will go into that more in our next meeting.	Of course, there is a number of goals, but I will explain it in detail next time.
とりあえず、今日は時間があまりないので終わります。	Anyway, we should close the meeting here as we are running out of time.	But today it’s not enough time, it’s over.
次回の会議スケジュールと資料を後程Eメールでお送りします。	I'll email you the schedule for the next meeting and the supplemental documents later.	The schedules and documents for the next meeting will be sent by email.
はい、承知致しました。	Yes, noted.	Yes, I realized it.
はい、お願い致します。	Yes, please.	Yes please.
カナさん、ちょっとお聞きしていいですか？	Hi Kana, can I ask you something?	Can you ask me a little?
うん。	Sure.	and yes.
日本に船便で身の回り品を送りたいと言っている学生さんがいるんです。	There is a student who wants to send his personal belongings to Japan by sea.	There are students who want to send their ships to Japan.
来月出国予定で、昨日事務所に質問に来ました。	He's leaving the country next month, and he came to the office yesterday asking for advice.	I was scheduled for the next month and I came to the office yesterday.
普段荷物を送るのにはY社を使っていると思うんですが、今朝電話で見積もりをお願いしたら1000ポンド以上かかると言われたんです。	I understand that we usually use Company Y for the shipment, but when I called them this morning to get a quote, they basically told me it would cost more than 1000 pounds.	I usually use the Y company to send my luggage, but if I ask for an estimate on the phone this morning, I said it would cost more than £1,000.
学生さんの予算をかなりオーバーしているので、他のやり方がないか探しているんですよね。	Since that is way out of his budget, I am trying to find other ways of doing it.	You’re looking for a student’s budget, so you’re looking for a different way.
なるほど。	Right.	So much.
Y社は手続きを一つのパッケージプランでやってくれるから便利なんだけど、その分ちょっと割高になりがちなんだよね。	Company Y offers the service as one whole package, and while it is very convenient, it tends to be a bit overpriced.	It’s easy for the company to make the process with one package plan, but it’s a bit expensive.
もし自分たちで国内の船会社と、日本で通関業者と運送会社をそれぞれ見つけられれば合計の費用は安く済むはず。	If we can find a shipping company here, and a custom broker and a delivery company in Japan separately by ourselves the total fee should be cheaper.	If we can find a domestic shipping company and a shipping company each in Japan, the total cost would be cheaper.
なるほど。	I see.	So much.
何年か前に同じような案件があったよ。	We had a similar case a few years ago.	There was the same case a few years ago.
確かここに記録があったような、ちょっと待ってね。	I think I can find the record here, give me a sec.	I’m sure there’s a record here, wait a while.
ありがとうございます。	Thanks.	Thank you.
あった。	Here it is.	was there.
貨物の引き取りと日本の港への送付はW社にお願いして、税関業務はE社にお願いして、そしたら輸送もE社が手配してくれているね。	We asked Company W to collect the cargo and ship to the Japanese Port in Tokyo, then for the custom paperwork we asked Company E and they arranged the delivery for us as well.	The pickup of goods and shipping to the Japanese port is requested by the W company, the customs operations are requested by the E company, and then the shipping is also ordered by the E company.
費用は全部で500ポンド。	The total fee was 500 pounds.	The total cost is £500.
もちろん、費用の部分は貨物のサイズや重量と、あと内容物の価値によって変わってくる。	Obviously, the fee will change depending on the size and the weight of the cargo as well as the value of the contents.	Of course, the cost part varies according to the size and weight of the cargo and the value of the material.
この時には関税はかからないですんだから良かった。	We could avoid getting any custom charge for this case, so that was good.	I’m glad I don’t pay taxes at this time.
その学生さんはどのぐらいの量送ろうと思ってるのかな？	How much stuff is he going to send?	How much does the student want to send?
この方と同じぐらいの量のはずです。	It should be about the same as hers.	It should be as much as this.
オッケー、まあもちろん全く同じ金額になるとは限らないけど、今回も前回と同じように進めていいと思う。	Ok, well obviously we shouldn't expect it to be exactly the same, but I'd say we can do it in the same way this time.	Okay, of course it will not be the same amount, but I think this time we can go the same as the previous time.
そうですね、W社に電話します。	Yeah, I will call Company W.	I call the W company.
荷物のだいたいの量と内容の価値を聞かれると思うから、学生さんに先に確認した方がいいかもね。	They would need a rough amount of the package and a value of the contents so maybe check with the student first.	If you want to know the amount and value of your baggage, you should check the student first.
あっ、そうですね。	Ah, yes.	Oh yeah yes.
メールします。	I will email him.	I will email.
そうだ、W社はもしかしたらCMSを導入したかもしれないから、聞いておいた方がいいよ。	Oh, also Company W may have introduced CMS so check that with them too.	Yes, the company may have introduced CMS, so you should hear it.
CMSって何ですか？	What is CMS?	What is CMS?
「コンテナー・マネジメント・サーチャージ」っていうんだけど。	"It's ""container management surcharge""."	It’s a “containers management charger”.
実際ちゃんとした費用なのかはわからない部分もあるんだけど、船会社によっては港で荷下ろしするときに通関業者に請求する所があるみたいなんだよね。	It is a little unclear if that is really a thing, but some shipping companies charge the broker when they unload the cargos at the port.	I don't know if it's really a good cost, but it's like a shipwreck company has a place to charge the carrier when it loads in the port.
手数料みたいなものかな。	It's like a handling fee.	It is like a fee.
なるほど。	I see.	So much.
前回W社からは請求されなかったから、今回も同じだといいんだけど。	Company W did not charge us the last time so hopefully it still is the case.	We didn’t pay for the previous time, so I hope this time is the same.
そうですね。	Yeah.	Yes is.
前の時のファイルを送っていただいてもいいですか？	Can I ask you to send me the file of the previous case?	Can I send you the previous file?
目を通したいです。	I want to go through it.	I want to go through the eyes.
もちろん。	Of course.	of course.
というか、匿名にして共有のデータベースにあげておくね。	Actually, I am going to make it anonymous and upload it on our shared database.	You will be able to share it anonymously in a database.
これからも同じような案件が出てくるかもしれないし。	We may have similar cases in the future.	Maybe the same case will come from now on.
ありがとうございます！	Thank you!	Thank you!
どういたしまして。	You're welcome.	How to go.
プレゼンのお手伝いをしてくださるそうで、ありがとうございます。	Thanks for offering to help me with my presentation.	Thank you for helping with the presentation.
私は今回のように大勢の前でプレゼンしたことがないんですよ。	I've never given a presentation in front of such big audience before.	I have never presented before so many people this time.
お手伝いできて嬉しいです！	I'm glad I could help!	I am glad to help you!
どんなプレゼンにするつもりですか？	What are you planning?	What kind of presentation are you going to present?
スライドショーをしようかと考えています。	I'm thinking about using a slide show.	I want to make a slide show.
我が社の購買層を示すのには円グラフが良いですよね。	I'll probably include a pie chart showing our demographic.	It’s a good way to show our company’s buyers.
そして地域別の販売高を示すのに棒グラフを使おうと思います。	Then I'll use a bar graph to show our numbers for each region.	And I will use a graffiti to show a different local sales rate.
グラフはただ見せるより説明した方が良いですよ。	I would suggest explaining the graph rather than just showing.	It is better to explain the graph than just show it.
それぞれの座標軸がなにを意味するのか忘れずに指し示してくださいね。	Be sure to point out what each axis means.	Do not forget to indicate what each coordinate axis means.
そうすれば、あなたが説明したいことを皆さんが確実に理解してくれます。	That way, you can make sure everyone understands what you're trying to show.	So you will be sure that you will understand what you want to explain.
それから、グラフの各領域の色を目立つようにすること。	Also, make sure the colors between the sections of the graph stand out easily.	Then make sure that the colors of each area of the graph are clear.
でも、あまり派手すぎないように。	Don't make it too fancy, though.	But let’s not be too good.
ごくシンプルにした方が良いですよ。	It's better to keep it pretty simple.	It is better to make it very simple.
はい！	Okay!	and yes!
分かりました。	That makes sense.	I understood.
この題目はどうでしょうか？	How does this theme look?	What about this topic?
これはちょっと複雑すぎますね。	That one is a bit too complicated.	This is a bit too complicated.
表示の内容が読みにくいです。	It's hard to read what the labels say.	The content is difficult to read.
代わりにこうしてみたら良いと思います。	I think you should try this one instead.	I would like to try this instead.
ありがとうございます。	Thanks.	Thank you.
プレゼン自体についてなにか秘訣はありますか？	Do you have any tips for the actual presentation?	Do you have any secrets about the presentation itself?
事前に何度か練習することでしょうか。	I would say practice a few times before.	Do you have to practice several times in advance?
前日に練習してストレスを感じるより、何日か余裕を持って練習したほうが良いですよ。	Space out your practice between a few days, so you won't be too stressed by practicing on the last day.	It is better to exercise for a few days rather than to feel stressed on the first day.
ナーバスになりすぎず、ホワイトボードを見ずに会場を見渡すようにすること。	Just don't be too nervous, and make sure to look around the room rather than at the white board.	Don’t be too narcissistic and make sure you look at the meeting without seeing the White Board.
プレゼンを暗記すればするほど、簡単に皆さんと目線を合わせられるようになりますよ。	The more you have your presentation memorized, the easier it will be to make eye contact with people.	The more you make the present, the easier you will be to match your eyes with you.
ちゃんと練習します。	I'll be sure to practice.	I practice properly.
その点を一番心配しているんです。	That's the part I'm most worried about.	I am most concerned about that.
ご協力ありがとうございました。	Thank you for your help!	Thank you for your cooperation.
どういたしまして。	No problem.	How to go.
上手く行きますように！	Good luck!	Let it go well!
