今日は調査の進め方についてトレーニングします。	I will be teaching you how to conduct research today.	Today we are training how to proceed with the research.	85	85	
オンライン調査みたいなものですか？	Like just searching online?	Like online research?	100	90	
それも含みます。	Yes and no.	It will also contain it.	100	100	
まず、出所が正規のところであるかどうか確認しないといけません。	First of all we need to make sure the sources are legitimate.	First, we need to make sure if the source is a regular place.	60	80	
ブログとかコラムなどはだめということですか？	So no blogs or editorial?	Do you not want blogs or comments?	70	90	
そのとおり。	Exactly.	That's right.	100	100	
最初に見るところは政府のホームページです。	The first place I would look at is government websites.	The first thing you see is the government website.	80	100	
政府の数字は、一般的に正確で信用性が高いものです。	They typically have accurate data that is trustworthy.	The number of government is high, accurately and.	30	20	
他に良いサイトは？	What other websites would be good?	What is the good site?	40	20	
大手の銀行、会計事務所、市場調査会社などの企業データも活用できます。	You can also check out major institutions like banks, accounting companies, and market research companies.	We can also use major banks, accounting offices, market research companies.	90	100	
どうしてですか？	Why those?	Why is it?	90	100	
こうした企業は有名で、たいてい質の良い市況報告を発行しています。	They are well known and typically publishes good market reports.	These companies are famous and usually issued a good market report.	100	100	
でも、市況報告は無料でないこともあります。	But some market reports aren't free.	But the market report is not free.	85	90	
なので、無料データで探します。	So stick to the ones that are free.	So we'll find it for free data.	70	80	
でも、もし、有料データで良さそうなのがあったら？	What if it seems the report is useful?	But if you think you can be able to pay data?	30	50	
私に相談してください。	You can consult with me then.	Please consult me.	90	90	
でも、君がやるのはほとんど予備調査だよ。	But a lot of the research you will be doing is preliminary research.	But it's almost a reserve research you do.	30	50	
経営陣に見せるような調査ではありません。	So it won't be presented to upper management.	It's not an research that we will show to the management.	90	90	
わかりました。	I see.	I realized.	70	60	
市況報告書を購入するようなケースはあるのですか？	Would there be cases when we would purchase market reports?	Do you have a case that will be buying a market report?	90	90	
詳しい実現可能性調査をするようなときには購入が必要になります。	We will need them when we conduct detailed feasibility studies.	When you are going to buy a product that will be in detail.	70	65	
そういう調査は上層部へ報告されるので、専門の第３者企業に認証された情報でなければなりません。	These will be presented to the upper management so we need to show that the information is validated by professional third-party companies.	This investigation should be certified by the three companies.	10	25	
わかりました。	Got it.	I realized.	70	40

今日はお越しいただいてありがとうございます。	Again thank you for coming in today.	Thank you for coming today.	100	100	
先週送って頂いた提案についてお話したかったんです。	I wanted to discuss the proposal you sent me last week.	I wanted to talk about the proposal I sent last week.	40	50	
はい、マーケットリサーチに関する件ですね。	Yes, the one regarding the market research.	Yes, it is about market research.	90	90	
社内で内容を検討したのですが、ちょっと我々が求めていたものとは違っていた感じがあります。	I reviewed the contents internally and felt that it wasn't quite something we were looking for.	I've considered the content within the company, but it feels a bit different from what we were looking for.	85	100	
もう少し具体的にお話して頂けますか。	Can you be a bit more specific?	Can you tell me a little more specifically?	100	100	
リサーチがもっと多くのトピックを掘り下げるのを期待していました。	We were hoping that the research will cover more topics in depths.	I was expecting a lot more of research to be grown up.	60	30	
しかしおおむねすでに私たちが知っている情報をカバーしていました。	But it basically covers information we already know.	However, we have covered the information we already know.	100	85	
会社への聞き取り調査など、もっと実地調査を期待されていましたか？	Were you expecting more field work like interviewing companies?	Have you been expecting more research on the company?	50	90	
はい、そうです。	That's correct.	Yes yes yes.	100	95	
その場合、私共のサービスの料金体制が変わってきます。	If that's the case, the cost structure for our service would be different.	In that case, our service system will change.	60	90	
それでは一律料金ではなくなるということですか？	So it won't be a flat price?	So it will not be the cost of the stock?	30	20	
組み合わせになりますね。	It will be a combination.	It will be a doesn't it.	0	0	
ですから基本料金の上に、実地調査を行う期間中に月々の依頼料がかかります。	So there will be the base price plus a monthly retainer fee for the duration of the field work.	So it will take a monthly request fee on the basic price.	10	40	
また、旅費と毎日の食費もかかります。	Also, travel expense and a daily meal allowance would have to be covered as well.	Also, it will cost you a travel costs and a day food fee.	60	70	
そうですか。	I see.	Yes is?	0	0	
上司と話し合うので、その料金体制で別の提案を出して頂けますか？	How about you give me another proposal with that cost structure so I can discuss it with my boss.	We're going to talk to our boss, so can you make another proposal on the price structure?	60	90	
はい、すぐにご用意できます。	Yeah I can whip that up quickly.	Yes, you can be prepared immediately.	10	30	
週末までに改訂した提案をお渡しします。	I think I can get you a revised proposal by the end of the week.	I will give you a suggestion that you have corrected by the end of the week	50	30	
大変ありがたいです。	That would be great.	It is very grateful.	60	50	
できるだけ早く送ってください。	Please send it to us as soon as you can.	Please send it as soon as possible.	100	100	
そうします。	Will do.	Will do.	100	100

お元気でしたか？	How have you been?	How are you doing?	100	100	
元気にしていました、ありがとうございます。	I've been good thank you.	I was well, thank you.	50	60	
最後にお話したのはいつでしたっけ？	When was the last time we talked?	When was the last time you talked?	10	40	
２年ほど前に御社の保険を更新した時だったと思います。	I think it was around two years ago when we renewed your insurance.	I think it was when I updated your company’s insurance about two years ago.	100	90	
ああ、そうでしたね。	Oh right.	Oh, it was so.	60	80	
今日お電話したのもその件なんです。	And I'm calling in regards to that.	I called you today, that is the case.	20	50	
えっ、もう更新の時期ですか？	Oh is it time for a renewal already?	Oh, is it time for the update?	90	100	
そうなんですよ。	That's right.	Yes is it.	100	100	
来年御社の販売量が拡大するかどうかお聞きしたかったんです。	I just wanted to ask if your sales volume will be increasing in the next year.	I wanted to ask you if your company will expand the sale level next year.	90	90	
それが保険料を算出する要素になるんですよ。	That will factor into calculating the insurance rate.	It will be an element that calculates the insurance fee.	90	100	
私たちの輸出事業のことですか？	You mean for our export business?	Is it about our export business?	100	100	
はい、そうです。	Yes that's correct.	Yes yes yes.	100	80	
そうですね、現在の販売高は400万ドル前後です。	Well, we are doing around four million in sales right now.	Yes, the current sales is about four million dollars.	100	100	
来年は600万ドルに拡大すると見込んでいます。	We anticipate that will increase to six million next year.	We will expand to $ 9 million next year.	35	0	
割引料金にしてもらえますかね？	Do you think we can get a discounted rate?	Can you give me a discount?	100	100	
そう思いますよ。	I think so.	I think so.	100	100	
御社はこれまで一度も保険請求をなさっていません。	You guys haven't had any insurance claims since you started.	You have never charged insurance before.	70	100	
つまりローリスクとみなされるんですよ。	So you guys would be deemed low risk.	That is considered a low risk.	90	100	
割引料金をご提供できると思います。	I think I can get you guys a lower rate.	I think you can provide a discount fee.	10	30	
それは素晴らしい。	That would be great.	That is great.	100	100	
料金に関しては来週またご連絡いたします。	I'll get back to you next week in regards to the rate.	We will contact you again next week for the fees.	100	100

それなら、もちろんできますよ。	Sure I can do that.	Well, of course you can.	10	30	
会社プレゼンの新しいバージョンが総務部から出ているか調べてくれるかい？	Can you check if there's a new version of the company presentation from the administration department?	Can you check if the new version of the company presentation will be from the general department?	40	10

一言で言えば、食品ベンダーがレストラン、ホテル、食料品店に売り込むチャンスなんだ。	In a nutshell, it's a chance for vendors of food items to pitch to restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores.	In other words, food vendor is a opportunity to sell it to the restaurant, hotel, food store.	40	65

最初の朝は皆、数日間ブースの準備と製品のセットアップをしていたものだからピリピリしているんだ。	The first morning, everyone is tense because they've spent the last few days preparing their booths and setting up their products.	The first morning is that we set up a lot of things and product setting up our booth for a few days.	5	55	
で、初日の後はみんな歩き回って、羽目をはずす気になるんだ。	Then after the first day, everyone walking around, people are ready to cut loose.	Then everyone was walking around after the first day and was worried to remove the ship.	5	0

ハンズオンの実演もやるんだけど、とても面白いんだ。	We're having a hands on demonstration that is quite entertaining.	I’m going to give you a yearly demonstration of the hands on, but it’s	0	0	
今年は若い人が沢山雇われたね。	So many young employees are hired this year.	This year, a lot of young people have been hired.	100	100	
ミレニアルが多すぎだと思うよ。	Too many millennials if you ask me.	I think there are too many Mikey.	10	0	
一緒に働いてみてどんな感じかい？	How has it been having them work for you?	How do you work together?	100	20	
順応しないといけないのは確かだね。	It's definitely an adjustment.	You are sure you need to be able to do it.	5	10	
我らの世代とは全く違うのは知ってるだろう？	You know they are very different from our generation.	You know that the generation is completely different, right?	100	100	
私にとっても学ぶ機会になってるよ。	It has been a learning experience for me as well.	It's a opportunity to learn from me too.	100	90	
明らかにミレニアルは違う勤労倫理を持っているよね。	Obviously, the millennials have different work ethic.	Well, Mi breakroom is clearly ethical.	0	0	
私は批判的かもしれないけど。	I might sound a little judgmental here.	I may be a bit important.	10	0	
彼らは少々甘やかされていて、怠けている感じがするね。	But they come off a little bit entitled and lazy.	They feel a bit slow and lazy.	75	80	
言いたいことわかるよ。	I see what you are saying.	I know what you want to say.	100	85	
我らの世代は、出世のために仕事に時間も労力も費やしてきただろう。	Our generation is willing to invest our time and effort in order to build our careers.	Our generation has spent time and effort on work for the career.	80	70	
一般的に我々は自分自身の仕事、会社の為に献身的なんだ。	We were generally committed to our jobs and the companies we work for.	In general, we are usually how we do our own work and help our company.	10	20	
そうだよ、私は25年間ずっとそうやってきた。	Yep, that's what I have been doing for the last 25 years.	Yes, I have been doing that for 25 years.	100	100	
でもミレニアルは我々ほど献身的ではなさそうだね。	But the millennials don't seem as committed as we are.	But Mi angry doesn't seem as we are so we are still so helpless.	0	0	
数年経つと、新しい機会を見つけて去っていく傾向にあるんだ。	They tend to leave for new opportunities after a few years.	In several years, we tend to find a new opportunity to leave.	10	10	
何を優先させるかというのも違うよね？	Their priorities are different too, right?	It’s different from what you want, right?	10	30	
彼らは長い目で見て、自分に有利になる様な事を求めているようだ。	It seems that they wanted something that benefit them in the long run.	They look for a long run and looking for something that will benefit for them.	90	85	
ミレニアルは不景気や職の不安定さを経験しているから、どんな事でも同じ状況が続くとは期待していないんだよ。	With the bad economy and the job insecurities the millennials have experienced, they don't expect things to stay the same.	Mr. some things that we have experience the slow economy and job are not expecting anything to continue the same situation.	0	10	
彼らが頻繁に職を変えるのはそれが理由かい？	Is that the reason they tend to switch jobs more frequently?	Is that why they change their jobs often?	90	100	
多分ね、でも私の勘違いかもしれないけど。	Maybe, but I could be mistaken.	Maybe, but I’m wrong.	0	5	
今年うちに雇われた従業員は真面目そうだけどね。	The ones we hired this year seem pretty decent though.	The employees we have been hired this year are serious.	90	35	
そうだね。	I agree with you.	Yes is.	70	30	
彼らが違う世代なんだという事を受け入れないといけないんだよ。	I need to accept the fact that they are totally different generation.	They need to accept that they are different consumers.	0	0	
そして少し大目に見てあげないと。	And I need to cut them some slack.	And we need to see a little bit of it.	30	20	
マリッサとケイラブの働きぶりを見たけど、彼らはとても真面目だよ。	I have supervised Marissa and Caleb, and they work really hard.	I saw the work of Marissa and Kately work, but they are very serious.	60	10	
ただ数年後には彼らも我々の元を去ってしまうのか心配だけど。	I am just afraid they will leave us in a few years.	But in a few years, they will be leaving us.	50	60	
それは私も心配だね。	That's my fear too.	I am worried too.	100	100	
彼らは失うには勿体ない人材だよ。	They are too good to let go.	They are very rough to lose.	10	10	
それは、もう一つ考えなければいけない事だね。	That's another thing to consider.	That's another thing I need to think about.	85	50	
どうにかして従業員の離職率を低めて、定着率を上げる方法を見つけないといけないな。	We have to figure out ways to reduce turnover and increase employee retention.	We need to get down the employee's turnover rate and find a way to increase the until the's until the is now.	0	0	
私にいけてる上司になれという意味かい？	Does that mean I have to be the coolest boss to make them like me?	Do you mean you will be a great boss to me?	0	0	
ならなくてもいいけど、なるとプラスにはなるね。	You don't have to, but it probably will help.	You don’t have to, but it’s going to be a plus.	100	95	
でも君は君のままでいいよ。	But you just have to be you.	But you can stay as you.	100	90	
もうすでに君は若い従業員にとって素晴らしい見本だよ。	You are a great role model for them already.	You are already a great opportunity for young employees.	100	100	
有難う。	Thank you for saying that.	Thank you.	100	100	
じゃあ今からまた最高の上司になって若い子たちの手助けをしてくるよ。	Now let me get back to being an awesome boss and help those young people.	Then I will be the best boss and help young people.	20	100	
話せて良かったよ。	It was nice chatting with you.	I'm glad you can talk to me.	10	80	
コピー用紙がもうすぐなくなりそうだけど。	We're almost running out of copy paper.	The copy paper will soon be lost.			
そうですか、気づいていませんでした。	Oh, I didn't notice.	I see, I didn't know.			
今すぐ注文しておきますね。	I'll order now.	I will order it right now.			
今週中に届くかな。	Do you think they'll come this week?	I wonder if they will arrive this week.			
週末までにたくさん印刷するものがあるんだよ。	I need to print out lots of things by weekend.	There are a lot of printed by the end of the week.			
いつも注文した翌日に届くので、大丈夫でしょう。	They usually deliver the next day, so it should be fine.	The day after you always ordered it, it will be okay.			
でも、念のために、注文の際に確認しておきますね。	But I'll double check when I order, just in case.	But, in case, I will check it when I order it.			
よろしく頼む。	Appreciate it.	Thank you.			
ついでに、大きめの封筒も少し頼んでくれるかな。	Can you also order large envelopes together?	Then can you ask me a little too?			
分かりました。	Sure.	I understood.			
他には何かいりますか？	Anything else?	Is there anything else I can help you with?			
いや、それだけだ。	No, that's it.	No, that's all.			
じゃ、頼んでおきますね。	Ok, it will be done soon.	I will ask you.			
ありがとう。	Thanks.	thank you.			
すみません、森さん、ちょっといいですか？	Excuse me, Mori-san, can I ask you something?	Sorry, Mr. last minute, do you have a moment?			
はい、何でしょう。	Yes, how can I help?	Yes, what is it.			
客先に出すこのメール文、これでいいでしょうか？	Could you check my e-mail letter to the client?	Can I send this email to the customer?			
えーと、ここ、語順をこういうふうに入れ替えた方がいいと思いますけど。	Hmm, here, I think you should change the word order, like this.	Well, I think it's better to change the language order like this.			
えっ、今のすごい早いですね。	Wow, it’s so quick.	Oh, that's a lot early now.			
コピペショートカットキーを使ったのよ。	I used copy-and-paste short cut keys.	I used a was a showy show.			
コントロールキーとCでコピーして、コントロールとVでペーストするんです。	You can press control key and C to copy, and then paste it with control and V keys.	I copy it with control and C and waste the control and V.			
へー、ショートカットキーは便利ですね。	Ah, short cuts are useful, aren’t they?	Well, the short key is useful.			
森さんは、パソコンでメール打つのも早いですよね。	You type e-mails so fast on the PC, don’t you?	Mr. last minute, you can send emails on your computer too early.			
僕は携帯メールは早く打てるんですけどね。	I can send text messages on my mobile very fast.	I’m going to get my phone quickly.			
中村さんたちはスマホ世代だから、フリック入力は早いのよね。	You are in the smartphone generation, so you use flick input skilfully.	Ours are a smartphone generation, so the earlier input is fast.			
私は、携帯だと画面の文字が小さくてメガネなしには良く見えないし。	I can’t see small letters on my mobile screen without reading glasses.	I don’t see any good with the screen letters in the setting up my glasses.			
スマホなら画面拡大できますよ。	But you can zoom in on the letters on a smartphone.	If you can expand the screen.			
うーん、それでも、なんか使いにくい。	I know, even so, I can’t see the whole picture.	Well, it’s hard to use.			
キーは２つ一緒に打っちゃうし、パソコンの方が楽だわ。	And my finger catches two keys at the same time, so I prefer to type on PC.	We will get two important parts together and it's easier to use the computer.			
僕のうちにはもう、ラップトップはないですよ。	We no longer use laptops in my family.	I have no laptop now.			
ふーん。	Hmm.	Hmm.			
みなさん、おはようございます。	Good morning, everyone.	Good morning, everyone.			
会議を始めますよ。	Could I have your attention, please?	We will begin the meeting.			
ご出席ありがとうございます。	Thank you all for coming.	Thank you for your join.			
さあ本題に入りましょう。	Let's get down to business.	Let's get into the topic.			
このミーティングは社内での紙の消費量を減らすことについて話し合うのが目的です。	The goal of this meeting is to talk about reducing paper consumption in our office.	This meeting is for us to talk about reduce the energy consumption within the company.			
アレックス、この件について意見はありますか？	Alex, what's your opinion on this?	Alex, do you have any opinion about this?			
素晴らしいアイディアだと思います。	I think it's a great idea.	I think it is a great idea.			
我が社は昨年コピー用紙の購入に10,000ドル以上費やしました。	We spent more than 10,000 dollars on purchasing printer paper last year.	Our company spent more than 10,000 dollars to buy a copy paper last year.			
インクカートリッジやペーパークリップ、フォルダーを含まずにこの金額です。	That doesn't even include printer ink, paper clips, and folders.	It's not included in ink, paper, folder.			
ペーパーレス化を進めることで多額のお金を節約できるでしょう。	We would save huge sums of money by going paperless.	You will be able to save a lot of money by going paperless.			
それに書類の保管に場所を取られすぎていますし。	We also dedicate too much storage space to paperwork.	And it's too much location for the documents.			
そうですね、私もそう思っていました。	Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.	Yes, I thought that too.			
フランシスコ、他にこの件について意見はありますか？	Francisco, do you have any other thoughts on this?	does anyone have any other opinion about this?			
まだ言及されていない利点があるとすれば環境にも優しい点です。	One advantage we haven't talked about is the environmental benefits.	If you have an advantage that you don’t yet mention it, it’s an			
私たちが書類をデジタル式で保存するようになればゴミも少なくなるでしょう。	We'll produce less waste if we start saving our paperwork digitally.	If we keep the documents in digital, there will be a lot of trash.			
それも私が取り組みたいと思っていたことです。	That's also something I wanted to work on.	That's what I wanted to do.			
アダム、あなたはどう思いますか？	What do you think, Adam?	What do you think, Adam?			
紙の使用を直ちに完全に止めるのは多分難しいでしょう。	It will probably be hard to go completely paper free at once.	It is probably difficult to stop the use of paper completely.			
少しずつ進めるしかないでしょうね。	I think we'll probably have to take baby steps.	You will have to move little by little.			
部によって書類作成へのニーズがまちまちなので、それぞれの部が部内の紙の使用量を管理すべきでしょう。	Each division should manage their paper usage since they all have different needs for documentation.	The process of making documents is right, so each department should manage the paper consumption within the department.			
新たに発生する書類をみんながデジタル式で保存することが第一歩かもしれません。	We could probably start by having everyone save new paperwork digitally.	We might have everyone keep this new document in the digital language.			
その後、だれかが過去の書類もデジタル式コピーに変換すればいいのです。	Then, someone could convert the old paperwork into digital copies.	After that, someone should convert the documents to a digital copy.			
最初のうちは苦労すると思いますが、ファイルの中で書類が行方不明になるのも防げるかもしれませんし。	I think it would take a lot of work in the beginning, but it might help prevent papers getting misplaced in files.	I think the first one will be hard, but it may be able to prevent the documents in the file.			
なるほど。	That seems like a good idea.	I see.			
どんな選択肢があるか技術チームに掛け合ってみましょう。	I'll meet with the tech team to see what our options are.	Let's meet with the technical team that has any options.			
いろいろなソフトウェアを比べてどれが最適か評価しないといけないですからね。	We'll need to evaluate different softwares to see which will work best.	You need to compare and evaluate which one is the best.			
それから実装やトレーニングにかかるコストを算出できますね。	Then we can calculate how much the implementation and training will cost.	Then you can calculate the cost of implementation and training.			
次のミーティングでは詳細をさらに議論できると思います。	I think we can discuss these details further next meeting.	I think we can get more details in the next meeting.			
話を進めて技術チームから複数のソフトウェア案を見せてくれる方にお越しいただきましょう。	I'll go ahead and bring in someone from the tech team to show you the different software options.	Let's go ahead and get to see several software technology teams.			
みなさん、お疲れ様でした！	Great meeting, team!	Congratulations to you!			
由衣さん、久しぶり！	Yui, it's been a long time!	Yumi, it's been a while!			
あ、キースさん、本当久しぶり！	Hi, Keith, yeah, it's been ages!	Oh, Mr. Bruce, it's been a while!			
そうそう、例の大型プロジェクト、由衣さんの案が採用だって？	Oh, by the way I heard your proposal got approved for that large-scale project.	Yes, what about the large projects, and Yumi's idea?			
わあ、もう聞いてます？	Wow, you've heard about that all ready?	Oh, have you heard it already?			
うん、この間ブラウン課長が話してたよ。	Yes, Mr. Brown was talking about that the other day.	Yes, the chief Brown has talked about it the other day.			
おめでとう。	Congratulations!	Congratulations to you.			
ありがとう。	Why thank you.	thank you.			
あの鬼のブラウン課長に認めて貰えるのはすごいと思うよ。	It's amazing that you got recognized from Mr. Brown, the section chief with a heart of stone.	I think that's amazing that the head of the president can agree with it.			
しー、それ聞こえたら大変。	Shhh, what if he catches you calling him that.	If you hear it, it’s hard.			
キースさんって、前ブラウン課長のプロジェクトチームに居たんだっけ。	Oh right, Keith, you were in his project team before.	Mr. .			
うん、なんか怖そうに見えるかもしれないけど、出来る人だよ。	Yup, he might look somewhat intimidating, but he's an able person.	Yeah, I might seem to be afraid but it's someone you can.			
それもあって、ちょっとプレッシャー感じてるんだ。	That's one of the reasons I feel a bit nervous.	That's what I am under a bit of pressure.			
ああ、かなり大きい案件だしね。	Well, I guess, it's a pretty big project, too.	Oh, it's a pretty big case.			
来週までに人員計画出して、人事にも確認取らなきゃで、あー、もう既に忙しくて。	I have to draft a staffing plan by next week, get approval from HR, aghh, I already have a lot to do.	We need to plan the staff by next week and make sure the staff is already busy.			
由衣さん、落ち着いて。	Relax, Yui.	Yumi, calm down.			
あのね、それ事前に人事の安田さんに話し通しとくと全然楽だから。	Look, it'll get much easier if you run it by Ms. Yasuda in HR beforehand.	Well, it’s not easy to talk to Mr. Well, I’m sure.			
あと、ブラウン課長のとこは残業気をつけてね。	But you should be careful if you do overtime when you work under Mr. Brown.	And be careful with the head of Brown.			
ありがと、頑張ってみる。	Thanks, I'll try my best.	Thank you, I will try it.			
ああ、ここでのんびりコーヒー飲んでる場合じゃないかも。	Well, I guess I shouldn't even be here having coffee.	Oh, I think you’re drinking coffee here.			
こら、おしゃべりな同僚と気分切り替えるのも必要でしょ？	Hey, you should also refresh yourself with a chatty coworker, right?	You need to switch to a little work with a chater, right?			
そうだ、ひと休みするって事で、金曜日はかなり忙しい？	Oh yeah, speaking of taking a break, are you super busy on Friday?	Yes, I’m going to take a vacation, and Friday is quite busy?			
えっと、１９日だよね？	let's see, you mean the 19th?	Well, it's the 24th, right?			
んーどうかな、明日どれくらい進むかによるけど。	Well, I really can't tell, depends on how far along I get tomorrow.	What about tomorrow?			
なんで？	What about it?	Why is it?			
早めに上がれそうなら、お祝いに俺が奢るっての、どう？	If you can get off early, how about I buy you a drink and toast to your success.	If you are going to get up early, I’m going to celebrate, what about it?			
やった、ゴチになります！	Yay, I like that idea!	I did it, it will be a hassle!			
あの角のバルとか、安いとこでよければだけど。	If you don't mind going to a cheapie place like that Spanish bar at the corner, though.	If you want to be cheaper, it’s cheaper.			
全然いい、気合い入れて定時に終わらせる。	Doesn't matter at all, I'll push myself to get the work done on time.	It’s good, it’s all done when it’s hard.			
仕事終わりにラインすればいい？	Should I LINE you when I'm done?	Should we finish work?			
俺、ラインあんまり見ないから、携帯メールの方がいいかな。	I don't check my LINE very often so I think a text message to my mobile is better.	I don’t see any line, so I’m going to email.			
あの既読とか付いて返信しなきゃいけない気がするの、苦手なんだよね。	I don't really like that massages get marked as read, and these makes you feel like you have to reply right away.	I feel that I have to read or reply.			
あ、ブラウン課長はいつもラインで、スタンプも送ってくるよ。	Oh, Mr. Brown always uses LINE and he sends messages with stickers, too.	Oh, Mr. Brown is always in the line and he will send you a stamp.			
まじで！？	No way!!	Are you serious!			
まじまじ、結構お茶目なとこあるよ。	Seriously, he does silly things sometimes.	I'm sure there's a lot of tea.			
そうだ、ブラウン課長も誘ってみない？	Yeah, why don't we ask Mr. Brown to join us?	Do you want to invite the head of Brown?			
うわー、それはちょっとまだハードル高いかも。	Oh no, that is too much of a challenge for me right now.	Well, that may be a bit hard to say.			
打ち解ければ結構いい人だし、今後仕事もしやすいと思うけど。	He's quite a nice guy once you get to know him and I think it'll help you when you work together.	It's a good person to know, and I think it's easier to work next time.			
うーん、ちょっと考えさせて。	Well, let me think about that.	Hmm, let me think about it.			
とにかく無理そうなら早めに連絡ちょうだい。	Anyway, if you can't make it, can you text me ASAP?	If you can’t, contact me early.			
了解。	You got it.	Okay.

どうしてそんなに高いんですか？	Why is it so expensive?	Why is it so expensive?			
どうしてと言われましても・・・	I don’t know why...	I wonder why...

とりあえず問合せ先に社の番号、予約までは取れなくても問い合わせをウェブ上で出来るようになっていると良いかな。	Well let's at least have our company number in the contact information and have them be able to contact us over the web even if it's not taking reservations.	I hope you can get the inquiry on the web if you don’t get the number of the company.			
それぐらいなら大丈夫だと思います。	I think I should be able to do something like that.	I think that’s okay.			
お客様がウェブで問い合わせをすると、社のメールに通知が来るように出来ます。	I will make it so we will get a notification on our company email when a customer makes an inquiry over the web.	If the customer gets a contact on the web, you can get a notification to the company's email

2人とも何食べてるの？	What are you two eating?	How many are you eating?			
タイ料理、ビルの目の前の弁当屋台に新しく増えたみたいです。	Thai food, there is a new bento stall in front of the building.	It seems that the food store in the near the building has increased.			
美味しいですよ！	It's good!	It is delicious!			
カロリー考えずいっぱい食べられる細身女子はいいねー。	I'm jealous of skinny girls who can eat what a lot without worrying about the calories.	She is good for she is not much longer in mind.			
それってセクハラとか、何ハラとかわかんないけどタブーワードじゃない？	Isn't that like sexual harassment or some sort of harassment, and it shouldn't be something you should say, right?	I don’t know what sexual harassment is, but it’s not tab all the way down.			
お、容姿について話すのはやめとくか。	Oh, I guess I shouldn't talk about appearances.	Do you stop talking about your appearance?			
そうだよ、最近何かとうるさいから気をつけな！	Yeah, you should be careful as that's something the company is pretty stringent on.	Yes, you have been very careful because you have something hard recently!			
それにしても、うちの社食はなんで主食1品、副菜2品なんてめんどくさいルールになったわけ？	But still, how come our company cafeteria has an annoying rule of only 1 main dish and 2 side dishes?	However, why does our food be very difficult to eat first food and two side dishes?			
バッフェ形式だとケンみたいに食べすぎる人がいて、採算取れなくなったんじゃない？	Because if we have a buffet, people like Ken will eat too much and maybe they aren't able to make a profit?	There are too many people who eat it like Ken and can't be pleased, right?			
勘弁してよー、俺そんなに食べないよ。	Oh please, I don't eat that much.	Oh, no, I don't eat so much.			
みんな知ってるよ、皿に毎回大盛りなの。	We all know that you always put a lot on your plate.	Everyone knows, it’s very much every time.			
腹が減っては仕事はできぬ！	You can't work if you're hungry!	I am not able to work!			
でた、戦国時代か。	There it is, you and your Sengoku period quotes.	And then, the time of the war.			
隣のビルの事務所に転職しようかな。	Maybe I should go work at the office in the building beside from us.	I'm going to change my job to the office in the building next to the building			
噂ですよね、隣のビルの食堂は美味しいって。	They say that the cafeteria is the building next to us is really good.	I hear that the dining room next to the building is delicious.			
そう、職場の環境って大事だよね。	Yeah, the work environment is important.	Yes, the workplace environment is important.			
特に俺みたいな大食いには、食の環境ってとっても大事なわけよ。	Especially for a big eater like me, where the food environment is very important.	Especially for a large meal like me, the environment is very important.			
うちら細身女子は、食べられる量が少ないから余計中身重視なのよ。	Us slim girls can't eat a lot so we're more focused on the content.	Our small girl is little too much to eat so it is too important.			
だから、うちの社食が毎日じゃ、いくらタダでも生き抜いていけないわけ。	So, if we eat at the company cafeteria everyday, we can't survive even if it's free.	So, if our food is every day, we can’t live any kind of free.			
俺はタダより美味い飯はないと思う。	Well, I think there is no better meal than a free meal.	I don't think I’m going to eat better than free.			
って事で、社食とってこよっと。	So, I will go grab some of the company meal.	Then, you can eat company.			
今日はケンさんの嫌いなグリービーンズ盛り盛りのおかずですよ。	They have loads of green peas that you don't like as the side dish today.	I am very pleased with Mr. Ken, but I am very pleased with the beans.			
えー、俺も弁当買いに行かないとかな？	Oh, maybe I have to go buy a bento too?	Oh, do you want me to go buy meals too?			
ケン、昼休み終わっちゃうよー。	Ken, lunch break is almost over.	Ken, it will end up lunch break!			
よお、海瑠、今日はお疲れさん。	Hey, Kyle, good work today.	Hi Kyle, good luck to you today.			
あれ海棠部長、もう帰られたのかと思ってましたが。	Oh, Kiichi, I thought you've left already.	I thought that Kiichi was already back.			
ワークショップの件でまだ何か？	Do you still have something you'd like to ask about the workshop?	Is there anything still in the workshop?			
いや特に、お前と話がしたかっただけ。	Not really, I just wanted to talk to you.	No, I just wanted to talk to you.			
この後まだ仕事か？	Are you still working after this?	Are you still working after this?			
今日は確か...	I believe I have....	I am sure today.			
いえ、打ち合わせが金曜に延期になったんでした。	No, a meeting has been postponed until Friday.	No, the meeting was on Friday.			
今日はこれで終わりですね。	I'm done for the day now.	This is the end today.			
じゃ、一杯付き合えるな。	Then, you can join me for a drink, huh?	So you can get a drink.			
相変わらず強引ですね、部長。	You always push me too much, Kiichi.	He is as strong as always, Mr.			
な、久しぶりだろ？	Oh well, it's been a long time, you know?	It’s been a while, right?			
まあ、断る理由はないですね。	Well, I have no reason to say no.	Well, there is no reason to refuse.			
お前も飲むのは嫌いじゃないだろうに。	You rather like drinking, don't you?	You don’t like to drink either.			
場所と相手によりますよ。	It all depends on where and with whom I drink.	It depends on where and who.			
じゃ、俺はお眼鏡にかなったんだな？	So I passed your test, I guess?	Then you got your glasses, right?			
ええ、喜んでください。	Yeah, you should be proud.	Yes, please be pleased.			
私は結構繊細で、人を選ぶタイプなので。	I'm quite sensitive and particular about people.	I'm quite sensitive and I'm the type to choose people.			
はは、俺相手にそんだけの口がきければ上等だよ、海瑠。	Ha-ha, not bad if you can talk to me like that, Kyle!	If you want to talk to me, it’s good, Kyle.			
入社の時からあなたみたいな疲れ知らずの上司に連れ回されましたからね。	I had been taken around by a tireless boss like you since I started working.	He took me to a unknown boss like you from the time you started working.			
誰でもたくましくなります。	Anybody would be tough.	Everyone will be very hard.			
お前みたいに反抗的だが真面目な新入り仕込むのは楽しかった。	I enjoyed training disobedient but earnest newbie like you.	It was a bit as you were, but it was fun to get in a serious new.			
そうですね、８年の長きに亘って。	You did, for eight long years.	Yes, it has been for a long 8 years.			
お陰様で、今ではどんなお偉方も平気ですよ、かなりクセのある方でも。	Thanks to you, I can deal with any important people now, even pretty difficult ones.	Thanks to you, any great person now is okay.			
じゃ、今のお前があるのは俺のお陰って事だな。	That means you owe what you are today to me, right?	Well, that's what you have now is because of me.			
部長、あなたのそのプラス思考には敵いませんよ。	No one can think as positive as you do, Kiichi.	Mr. Ko, your plus thinking is not an target.			
ああ、お前に言いたい事がある。	Well, I have something to say, Kyle.	Oh, I have something to say to you.			
お前が経営企画に引っ張られた時、あそこがエリートコースだから営業抜けさせたんだ。	When you got promoted to the corporate planning, I let you leave the sales because you'd get into the fast lane there.	When you was reduced to the management project, that was because it was an average course.			
４年で異動希望、それもマーケに出すなら、手放すんじゃなかった。	If I knew that you were going to request a transfer in four years to marketing too, I wouldn't have let you go.	If you want to move in four years, it was not good to lose.			
あなたに育てていただいたので、今独り立ちできてるんです。	You've raised me so that I can stand on my own now.	I have grown you, so I am now alone.			
すぐCX企画部の評価を上げて見せますよ。	I'll show you that I'm capable of building up a reputation for CX promotion soon.	I will get the assessment of the CX project department right away.			
あー、わかったよ、どんだけ巧くやるんだか見ててやるよ。	Ah, okay, I'll see how artfully you do that.	Oh, I know, I’m going to see how much you’re going to do.			
はは、楽しんでいただけると思います。	Ha Ha, I think you'll enjoy it.	I think you will enjoy it.			
とりあえず、昔行ってた蕎麦屋でいいだろ？	Anyway, you don't mind the soba place we used to go, do you?	Well, you should be a restaurant that you used to go to before, right?			
この時期は美味い日本酒入れてるぞ。	They have fine sake this time of the year.	This time, we’re going to get delicious wine.			
いいですね。	Sounds good.	Well well well.			
オフィス戻って鞄取ってきますね。	I'll go back to my office to get my bag.	I'll get my bag back to the office.			
海棠部長は、先に行っててくださって構いませんよ。	It's okay if you go ahead, Kiichi.	Kiichi doesn't care if you're going to go ahead.			
了解 。	All right.	Okay.			
遅けりゃ、先にやってるぞー 。	If you take too long, I'd start by myself, alright?	If you are late, you’re going to do it first.			
ご随意に。	As you please.	Thank you.

で、求人の応募を審査するコツって何？	So what's the tip in screening job applications?	So what is the tip to review the application for the job?			
あぁ、一通ずつ全部見る時間がないからさ。	Well, we don't have time to review every single one of them.	Well, I don't have time to see it all one by one.			
僕は通常カバーレターをざっと見るよ。	I typically do a quick review of their cover letter.	I usually look at the cover letter.			
カバーレターが良かったら、その履歴書を見るね。	If their cover letter is interesting then I will look at their resume.	If the cover letter is good, look at the history.

しかも僕より年上だ。	He's older than me too.	And it's more elderly than me.			
それって気まずくならない？	That could make things awkward right?	Is that not hard to be able to clean?			
それはほんと、君次第だよ。	That's up to you really.	It really depends on you.			
僕は個人的には気にしないけど。	I personally don't mind.	I personally don’t care about it.			
だって、イレーンは僕よりだいぶ年上だし。	I mean Elaine is a lot older than me.	I mean, I'm more old than me.			
いいとこ突くね。	Good point.	It is a good place.			
考えてみるよ。	I'll think about it.	I will think about it.			
大概は直感でしょ。	A lot of it is about gut feeling.	It is probably very intuitive.			
実際その人に一回会ったら、大抵その人が採用したい人かそうじゃないかってわかるよ。	Once you actually meet the person, you can usually tell if this is the person you want to hire or not.	In fact, if you meet the person, you know that it is usually the person who wants to hire it.			
彼らに会うのが待ちきれないよ！	I can't wait to meet them!	I can't wait to meet them!			
まぁ、まず君の候補者リストに入らないといけないんだけどね！	Well, they will have to get on your shortlist first though!	Well, I need to go on your candidates first!

お客様が希望されていた布がバックオーダーになっていると倉庫から連絡が入りました。	I just got a word from our warehouse that the fabric you want is actually back-ordered.	The customer was contacted from the warehouse that was ordered.			
バックオーダーとはどういう意味ですか？	What does back order mean?	What does the back- orders mean?			
品物が手に入らないという事ですか？	Am I not getting it at all?	Do you think you can get the goods?			
ええっと、バックオーダーとは一時的に品切れになってしまい、オーダーが遅れてしまう事です。	Well, back order means the item is temporarily out of order causing a delay on your order.	Well, the order is temporary and the order will be delayed.			
でも、店舗の従業員はちゃんと私のオーダーを取ってくれましたよ。	But the store associate I saw earlier placed an order for me.	But the store employees took my order well.			
希望されていた品はとても需要が高いものでして。	The particular pattern you want is in high demand.	The goods that were expected are very high.			
うちの店舗と倉庫の間できちんとコミュニケーションが取れてなかったようです。	And obviously there was miscommunication between our store and the warehouse.	It seems that we can't communicate well between our store and the warehouse.

その間、私の方でも別の卸売業者から品を購入できないかと全力を尽くしています。	Meanwhile, I am doing my best to source it from a different vendor for you.	In the meantime, I am doing my best to buy goods from another peter.			
でもなかなか見つからないもので。	But I do not have much luck.	But it's pretty hard to find.			
先ほど申し上げたように、人気商品の為ほとんどの店は品切れ状態のようです。	As I mentioned already, most places have run out of them due to its popularity.	As I said before, most stores seem to be in a best way to be in a while.			
一か月も待てません。	Well, I can not wait another month.	I can't wait a month.			
私が希望している品と似た感じのはありますか？	Do you have any pattern that is very similar to the one I want?	Do you feel similar to what I have been looking for?			
今手元で見本を開いているところです。	I am actually opening up our sample book right now.	I'm just open a review in my hand.			
ターコイズが背景のペイズリー柄のものですよね？	You wanted the paisley one with turquoise background, right?	The thing that will be the one in the background, right?			
はい、柄は緑、白、紺色です。	Yes, the patterns are green, white, and navy blue.	Yes, the color is green, white, and blue.			
ほぼ同じの物が一つありますよ。	I have one that's almost identical.	There is almost one of the same ones.			
違うのは背景の色のみです。	The only difference is the background color.	The different color is only the color of the background.			
ティール色ですが、柄の色は全く同じです。	It's teal, but the colors of the patterns are exactly the same.	It is green, but the color is the same.			
じゃあそれをお願いします。	Well, I would like to go ahead and get it then.	So please do it.

ですが、スライデルにある店舗にはあるそうです。	But it seems that the store in the town, Slidell, has some.	However, there is a store in S within the S within the building.			
こちらへ配達して貰う事も、お客様の方で取りに行かれるのも可能です。	I can have it delivered here or you can go pick it up yourself.	You can also be able to deliver it to the customer.			
ご都合の良い方をどうぞ。	Whichever works better for you.	Please take a good one.			
自分で運転して取りに行きます。	I think I am going to drive up there to pick it up.	I will drive myself and take it.			
本当に申し訳ございませんでした。	I apologize again.	I'm really sorry about that.			
またのお越しをお待ちしております。	I hope you will consider us again for your future shopping.	We are waiting for you again.

いやあ、あなたや部の人たちのサポートがなかったらそうはいかなかったと思います。	Well, actually if it wouldn't have had the support from you and the entire department, I cold have never done it.	Well, I think it would not be great if you and the staff don't have any support.			
人がよすぎるわね、ジャック	You're too kind Jack.	It’s too much, Jack.			
そういえば、良いニュースがあるのよ。	Actually, I have some really good news.	For example, there is a good news.

外国に引っ越すっていう意味？	You mean moving to a different country?	Do you mean you will move to abroad?			
もちろんそれもそうだけど。	Of course there's that.	Of course, that is so.			
自分の本当の夢を追うためにこんな大企業を去るってこと。	I mean leaving this big company to pursue your real dream.	It is that you leave such a large company to follow your true feelings.

ありがとう、そう言ってくれて。	Thanks for saying that.	Thank you, I said that.			
ただ、これからもときどき俺たちに近況報告するのは忘れないでね。	Just don't forget to let us know how you're doing now and then.	But don't forget to report it to us in the future.

本当にそうですよね。	Yes, it certainly is.	I really do.			
実は私たちは二月に台湾のB社を訪れる予定があったのです。	Actually, we had plans to visit Company B in Taiwan in February.	In fact, we had plans to visit the B company in February.

こんばんは、荒木さん。	Good evening Mr. Araki.	Hello Mr. Ara push.			
知っているとは思うけど、年に二回各社員の評価をする為に面談をしているんだ。	As you know, we have meetings twice per year to review the performance of each employee.	I think you know, but I have a interview to make a assessment of each employee twice a year.			
この五日間で君の課内の全ての社員と面談をする予定なんだ。	We are planning to meet with all of the employees in your department over the next five days.	I am planning to have a meeting with all of your employees in the past five days.			
そうなんですね。	I see.	I see.			
緊張する必要はないよ。	There is no need to be nervous.	You don’t have to be nervous.			
では始めようか。	Shall we get started?	So let's start.			
はい、お願いします。	Yes, please continue.	Yes, please.			
わかった。	Okay sure.	I realized.			
最近同僚との関係はどうだい？	So how is your relationship with your coworkers lately?	How is your relationship with your colleagues these days?			
同僚とは協力し合えていると思います。	I feel that I cooperate well with my coworkers.	I think we are working together with our coworkers.			
私はオフィスの皆とコミュニケーションを取ってよく意見を共有しあったりしています。	I communicate with everybody in my office, and we regularly share ideas between each other.	I share my opinion with everyone in the office.			
何か言っておきたい同僚との問題はある？	Are there any issues with coworkers you’d like to mention?	Do you have any issues with your colleagues you want to tell me?			
いえ、特にないです。	No, none at all.	No, not especially.			
皆とても親切で面倒見が良いんです。	Everybody is very friendly and helpful.	We all look forward to working on it.

はい、最近では上手くいっていると思います。	Yes, I feel that I have been doing well lately.	Yes, I think it’s going well lately.			
2年間この会社で働いてきましたし仕事にも慣れました。	I've been with the company for two years and I've got used to my job.	I have been working for this company for two years and I am used to work.			
それにこの６ヶ月間は、社外でエクセルのクラスを取り続けてきました。	Also over the past six months I've been taking classes outside of work to learn excel.	In the past 6 months, I have continued to take excel classes outside the company.			
そのおかげで効率よく仕事が進むようになり新しい情報を同僚に共有しています。	This has helped improve my efficiency at work and I'm sharing my new information with my coworkers.	That will make the work more productive and shared new information with my coworkers.			
そっか、クラスを取ってることはとても素晴らしいね。	I see, that's great that you are taking these classes.	You’re going to get a class is great.			
そのインフォメーションがオフィスの役に立ってることは確かだよ。	I'm sure that information is helpful to the whole office.	I am sure that this information is useful in the office.			
何か自分の弱点や将来改善していきたい点はあるかい？	Do you have any weaknesses or things you'd like to improve on in the future?	Do you have any issues and improve your weaknesses?			
期日に間に合わなかったり短い期間でやらなければない事がたくさんあるとストレスが溜まってしまうんです。	Well, often I get stressed if I miss a deadline or if I have too much work to do in a short amount of time.	If you don’t make it in time for the short period, you’ll be stressed.			
ストレスと上手く付き合っていくことが私の課題かと思います。	Managing my stress better is definitely something I would like to work on.	I think it’s my challenge to be well with stress.

嬉しいです、ありがとうございます。	That would be great, thank you so much!	I am glad, thank you.			
もちろん。	No problem at all.	of course.			
最後に一つだけ質問するよ。	Ok, I have one final question.	I will just ask one last question.			
何かA社での勤務についての悩みや質問はあるかね？	Do you have any concerns about working here at Company A, or any questions for me?	Do you have any problems and questions about work at Company A?			
特にないです。	No I don't.	Not especially.

ありがとうございました。	Thank you.	Thank you.			
ビクター、何をしてるの？	Hey Victor, what are you working on?	What are you doing, Bill?			
先週から退職貯蓄の設定をしてるんだよ。	I've been setting up my retirement from the past week.	I've been making retirement money since last week.			
君はどう設定した？	How do you have your savings for retirement set up?	What's your setting?			
僕は全部A社の株に投資してるよ。	All of mine is invested into Company A stock.	I'm investing in all of the company’s shares.			
A社は給与の4％までの貯蓄分には同額を補助してくれるから。	Company A matches everything that we put in up to four percent.	Company A will provide us with the similar amount to four percent of the salary.			
ビクター、君はどうしてるの？	How about you, Victor?	What are you doing, Bill?			
うん、幾らかはA社の株に行くようにしてるよ。	Yes, some of mine goes into Company A stock.	Yes, I’m trying to go to the company’s shares.			
ただ、自社株だけに投資したせいで、退職後の夢に敗れてしまった人々は沢山いるからね。	However, many people have watched their retirement dreams disappear because they invested only in the company stock of their employer.	But because of the amount of people who have been lost in their stock, there are a lot of people who have lost in their retirement secret.			
そういうわけで今調整しているところなんだよ。	That's why I've been working on mine.	That's why we are making adjustments now.			
君も分散させたほうがいいよ。	You've got to diversify, Tim.	You should be distributed too.			
だけどお金は個人的な事じゃないか。	Well, I think money is a very personal matter.	But money is personal.			
それに口出ししようっていうの？	Are you trying to get into my business?	And what do you want to talk about?			
いやいや、そうじゃないよ。	No, no, no, not at all.	No, that's not it.			
気をつけたほうがいいよって言いたかっただけだよ、ティム。	I'm just looking out for you, Tim.	I just wanted to tell you that it is better to be careful, Tim.			
ほとんどの人が君と同じようにするけど、長期的にみると効率よくないからさ。	Most people do exactly what you do, but in the long term, it doesn't make sense.	Most people do it just like you, but it's not good for a long time.			
僕もそうしてたんだけど、色々調べ始めたんだよ。	I was doing it too, but I started doing some research.	I did that, but I started to check it a lot.			
そうか、じゃあどうしたらいいの？	Well then, what do you suggest?	So what should I do?			
いいかい、もしA社が失敗したら株の価値はなくなって全てを失うことになるだろ？	Here's the thing, if Company A fails, we lose everything and the stock will be worthless.	If Company A does, it will lose everything that is not worth, right?			
ターゲットデート・ミューチュアルファンドがいいよ。	Go with a target-date mutual fund.	Our target date and any coworkers can be helped.			
何それ？	What's that?	What is that?			
株や債券やその他の投資を組み合わせたファンドだよ。	It's a fund holds a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.	It is a fund that is putting together shares and yen.			
投資戦略に合わせて、時間が経つにつれてその組み合わせが徐々に変わっていくんだ。	Over time, the mix gradually shifts according to the fund's investment strategy.	In terms of the investment strategy, the wrong telling us the start to change.			
ターゲットデートファンドは特定の退職日が頭にある人のためにデザインされた長期投資ファンドだよ。	Target date funds are designed to be long-term investments for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.	Our target date fund is designed for someone who is on specific retirement days.			
へえ、調べてみよう。	Wow, I'll have to check it out.	Let's look it up.			
自分でやってるの、それとも会計士を雇った？	Do you do that by yourself, or did you hire an accountant?	Do you do it yourself or you hired an accountant?			
自分でやってるよ。	I've been doing it myself.	I do it myself.			
おはようございます、こちら倉庫担当のハリーですが、どのようなご用件ですか？	Good morning, this is Harry from the warehouse, how may I help you?	Good Morning, this is from the warehouse manager, but what do you use?			
おはようございます、ハリーさん、こちらマーケティング部のチャーリーです。	Good morning Harry, this is Charlie from the Marketing department.	Good Morning Mr. Hawaii, this is Ms. such a marketing department.			
新年のカレンダーが届いたかどうか知りたいのですが。	I would like to know whether the new year calendar has arrived or not?	I want to know if the new year’s calendar has arrived.			
申し訳ないです、メールにも書いた通り、新年のカレンダーが届くのは遅れるかもしれません。	I'm sorry, as I wrote in the email the new year calendar might arrive late.	Sorry, as I wrote in the email, it may be late to reach the new year’s calendar.			
あらら、じゃ、うちのオフィスにはいつ納品されますか？	Oh, so when it will be delivered to our office?	When will you deliver it to our office?			
業者によると一月の頭ごろには届くということです。	Our vendor said it will be delivered around early January.	According to the supplier, it will arrive around the beginning of January.			
カレンダーが届いたらお電話いただけますか？	Would you please call me later when the calendar arrive?	Can you call me if you get a calendar?			
もちろん、そうします。	Sure, I will.	Of course, I will do that.			
確認のためですが、200部注文されましたよね？	Just to make sure, you ordered 200 pieces right?	I'm sure you ordered 200 pieces, right?			
ええ、そうです。	Yes, that's right.	Yes yes yes.			
分かりました、あと、カレンダーは業者から一括してではなく、幾つかのバッチに分けて送られる予定だということもお伝えしておきますね。	Okay, I would also like to tell you that our vendor will not send the calendar to your office at once, but divided into several batches.	I know, I will tell you that calendars are not from the supplier and they are planning to divide it into some parts.			
なので、200部注文されたとしたら、まず50部ほどお渡しできます。	So, maybe if you ordered 200 pieces, I can give you around 50 pieces at first.	So if you ordered 200 pieces, you can give it to about 50 pieces.			
それから、次の日に業者からまた送られてきたら、さらに50部お渡しできます。	And then, if our vendor send it again the next day, I can give you another 50 calendars.	Then, if you send it again the next day, you can give it more 50 pieces.			
これは、全国の支社にもカレンダーを届ける必要があるからなんです。	This is because we also need to deliver the calendar to our branch offices throughout the country.	This requires a calendars to be delivered to the entire country.			
それに、支社に届ける時間が必要なので。	And we need time for delivery to our branch offices.	And we need time to deliver it to the office.			
はい、分かりました。	Okay, I understand that.	Yes, I understand it.			
とにかくカレンダーが用意できたら教えてください。	Just please inform me when the calendars are ready.	If you have any calendars ready, please tell me.			
もうすでに遅れてますから。	Because it's already late.	It is already late.			
分かりました。	Okay.	I understood.			
他に何かお手伝いできますか？	Is there anything else I can help you?	Can you help me something else?			
いや、それだけです。	No, that's all.	No, that's all.			
ありがとうございました。	Thank you.	Thank you.			
どういたしまして。	You're welcome.	How to go.

やあ、ユーチン、声が聞けて良かったよ。	Hi Yichin, good to hear your voice.	Oh yeah, it's good to hear your voice.			
オーストラリアはどう？	How is Australia?	What about in in in in in in in			
実はうだるような暑さですよ。	Sweltering actually.	It's really hot.			
東京の方がまだましでした、ここに戻るのはうんざりです。	Tokyo was much better, it sucks to be back here.	I'm still tired of returning here, and I'm not sure about returning to the office.			
さて、当社に関するあなた方のファンドの考えについて、全員同じ認識だということを確認するため、今日はお2人にも電話で参加してもらいました。	So I've got you 2 on the phone because I wanted to make sure we are on the same page regarding your fund's intentions with our company.

サイラーからは、懸念があるとのフィードバックを内々でいただいています。	Sylar has given me some feedback in confidence as to some concerns he has.	From the than the than the than that, we have a concern.			
そう、その件に関しては、サイラーからEメールをもらっています。	Yes, I got an email from Sylar regarding that.	Yes, I have received an email from the.			
サイラーの懸念はワン フェイホン社長に伝えてあり、フェイホンは御社の今後の方向性を考えるため過去の資金繰りを確認しています。	I've taken his concern to Wang Feihong and he has been looking at past financials to see where you may be heading.	The concern for the than the than the customers is sure to tell the president of one who is well-known and flight of your company's future direction.			
ここだけの話、もちろんサイラーもいますが、あまり良い状況ではありません。	Just between you and me, and Syler of course, this doesn't look good.	You can only talk about this, of course, but it's not very good.			
ワン フェイホンは、恵子さんが、なんと言いましょうか、えー、慎重であることを主に気にしています。	Wang Feihong is mostly concerned at how, what's the word, um, careful, Keiko is.	I am concerned that you will be sure that you will be careful.			
ユーチン、いいんです、言葉を選ばなくてもいいですよ。	Yichin, it's fine, you don't have to sugar coat.	Eugina, you don’t have to choose the word.			
恵子さんは頑固で時間がかかりすぎると。	She is way too stubborn and slow.	Keiko is too hard and Time is too long.			
フェイホンは、そろそろ何らかの変革があることを期待していたのですが、悪くはなっていないにしろ、変わってないようで。	He was expecting some sort of change by now, but it seems to be the same, if not worse.	I was expecting some kind of change, but it seems that it didn't change.			
ユジーナ、役員会議は最悪でしたよ。	Eugina, the board meeting was a disaster.	Mr. Gina, the board meeting was very bad.			
恵子さんはアレックスを制止して、私の質問もうやむやにしました。	She was shutting Alex off, and dancing around my questions.	Keiko stopped Alex and did it already without me question.			
ワン フェイホンがあの会議に同席することなんて考えられません。	I can't imagine Wang Feihong himself sitting at that meeting.	I can't think that one free will be at that meeting.			
あの人、爆発しますよ。	He will explode.	He will burst.			
そうですね、あなたの質問には全く答えなかったと言ってましたね。	Yes, you told me she didn't answer any of your questions..	Yes, I said that your question was not able to answer it.			
当社は御社の最大の投資元の一つなのに、非常に失礼です。	It's very disrespectful as we are one of your biggest investors.	We are one of your biggest investments, but very sorry.			
当社の経営陣のふるまいについては、深くお詫びを申し上げる以外に言葉もございません。	I don't know what to say other than I deeply apologize for their behavior.	There is no other word except to say very confident apology for our management.			
恵子さん、大丈夫ですかね？	Is she okay though?	Is it okay, Keiko?			
といいますと？	Meaning?	So what does it mean?			
えーと、あの方、その、よくわかりませんが、心身衰弱かなんかでしょうかね？	Well, is she, um, having some sort of, I don't know, breakdown?	Well, he’s not sure, but do you think it’s a heart rate?			
どうしてあそこまで自分の世界に行っちゃってるのか、理解できないんです。	I don't understand how she can live in la-la land that long.	I don’t know why you’re going to your world.			
何かおかしいですよね、恵子さんの健康状態が心配ですよ。	There seems to be something wrong and I'm worried for her wellbeing.	It’s crazy, I’m worried about your health situation.			
それは新たな見方ですね。	That's a new take.	That's a new perspective.			
そんなことは考えもつきませんでしたが、うん、それはありえるかも。	I didn't think about that, but yeah, that is a possibility.	I didn’t think about that, but it may be possible.			
個人的なことや病歴などはわかりませんので、なんとも言えません。	I don't know her personal affairs, or her medical history, so I can't really weigh in on that.	I don’t know personal and health experience, so I can’t say anything.			
ですが、当社の持続可能性のためには、策を講じる必要があることは確かで、当社の方向性はCファンドにかかっております。	But I do believe something needs to be done for the sustainability of our company and I am counting on C Fund for direction.	However, for our their their that we need to take action for our until our that we are sure that ourre doing ourre on the C Fund.			
とにかく、私としてはまだ、R社の状況を好転させるためにご一緒に取り掛かることを約束しますが、警告として言います、ワン フェイホン自身の関心は御社から離れていくと思います。	So I'm still committed to working with you to turn things around for Company R, but just as a heads up, Wang Feihong himself will not be focusing on you guys.	Anyway, I will still make the R company's situation and say, but I am trying to be a warning, I am far from your company.			
御社と協力することは許可されていますが、今後フェイホンからのインプットはないでしょう。	He has allowed me to work with you, but there won't be any input from him.	We have been allowed to cooperate with your company, but we will not be able to enter the within the next time.			
率直に言ってくださりありがとうございます。	Thank you for being straight with me.	Thank you for your wide ranged.			
ユジーナ、この情報はここだけにしないといけませんね。	Eugina, I think this information should just be among us.	Mr. Gina, you have to only have this information here.			
えー、実のところ、これはうちの経営陣への警鐘だと思いますね。	Well, I actually think this is a good wakeup call for them.	Well, in fact, I think this is a beal to our management.			
Cファンドが関心を失っていることを当社の経営陣が知ったら、きちんと対処するでしょうから。	If they know C Fund is losing interest, they may finally get their act together.	Our management team will deal with it if C Fund knows that they are losing interest.			
経営陣へ何と言うかはあなたにお任せしますよ、でも、私がここにいることを忘れないでください。	It's up to you what you tell management, but please remember I am still here.	I will leave it to you, but don’t forget that I’m here.			
背水の陣は敷かない方がいいでしょう。	It's better not to completely burn bridges.	You should not have any  focus on the water.			
お越しいただきありがとうございます。	Thank you for coming in.	Thank you for coming.

主要製品は牛肉と豚肉になります。	Key products will be beef and pork.	The main product will be the chief product and pork.			
さて、関税だけでなく、協定は国々の間にその他の利益ももたらします。	Now aside from the tariffs, the deal also brings other benefits among the countries.	Well, not only tariffs, but the agreement bring other profits between countries.			
例えば、これによって他の国の他の企業が、政府との契約に入札する機会を持つことができます。	For example, this will open up opportunities for other companies in other countries to bid for government contracts.	For example, these other companies can offer opportunities to bids for the government contracts.			
典型的に、政府の契約には、地元の企業だけが入札できるのですが、これによって変わるでしょう。	Typically, government contracts can only be bid by the local companies but this will change that.	In the standard sense, the government contract can only bid but it will change.			
そして、関税引き下げもしくは撤廃によって、外国企業が海外での政府契約入札においてより競争力をもつことが出来るようになります。	And with the reduction or removal of tariffs, it will allow foreign companies to be more competitive in bidding for government contracts abroad.	And with tariffs, and it will be more competitive in the contracting of abroad.			
つまり、貿易協定は、単なる関税の引き下げや撤廃だけでなく、関係国の発展を促す他の機能も持つのです。	So the trade deal is not a simple reduction or removal of tariffs but has other features to promote the prosperity of the countries involved.	So the trade agreement is not only about tariffs and the other features that encourage the growth of the relationship.			
何時間でも話すことができますが、まだまだこの先丸々一日ありますので、この辺で止めておきますね。	I could go on for hours but since we still have a whole day ahead of us, I will stop around here.	I can talk to you in many times, but I still have a whole day, so I will stop it here.			
では、この後は、政府機関Aの貿易委員の方々とのパネルセッションになります。	So after this, we will have a panel session with the trade commissioners from Government Agency A.	Then, the trade meeting with the government agency A will be a board.			
彼らは貿易協定の利点に関する見通しを教えてくれ、企業が利用することのできるいくつかの政府プログラムについて説明してくれます。	They will provide their insight on the benefits of the trade deal, and explain some of the government programs that companies could use.	They will explain the eyes on the trade agreement and explain some government programs that companies can use.			
これらは、輸出業者が新しい市場へ進出するのに利用できる可能性のあるものだと思います。	These would be things that exporters could potentially use to expand to a new market.	These are projecting a exporter can be used to new markets.			
パネルセッションは、私の後ろにある部屋で開かれますので、この後、どうぞそちらに向かってください。	The panel session will be held in the room behind me so please head on over after this.	The panel meeting will be opened in the room behind me, so please go to your side.

うん、そうだな。	Yeah, you're right.	Yes yes yes.			
あいつ、今プレゼンの準備してるのかな？	Is he preparing for his presentation now?	He is making a presentation now?

もし、時間があったら、何か手早くできる案がないかなと思って。	If you have the time, I was hoping you might be able to whip something up?	If you have time, I think there is no idea to get something early.			
僕の思い違いでなければ、そのプロジェクトを指揮ってませんでしたか？	If I remember correctly, weren't you the one who spearheaded that project?	Did you not be in charge of that project if you don't be wrong?			
だったら、その過程で役に立った人の方がいい仕事をするんじゃないでしょうかね。	Surely someone so instrumental in its development would do a better job?	So, do you think someone who helps in that process is better?			
そうだけど、グラフィックデザインは得意じゃないのよ。	Yes, but graphic design is not my forte.	Yeah, but graphic design is not good.			
それに、今は、大事に育ててきた製品をお客さんにお披露目する展示会に全力を注がないといけないの。	Plus, I now need to put all my effort into things like the trade show, to help get my baby released to consumers.	And now we need to focus on the exhibition that we have grown products to our clients.

もし、マークの取引先から何か来たら、そちらの仕事を優先しますよ。	If anything comes through from one of his clients, that will have to take priority.	If you get something from the trading company of Mark, you will prioritize your work.			
はい、もちろん。	Yes, of course.	Yes of course.

そこの会社、デザインがかなり初期段階のものだと知ってるんだよね？	They know the designs are a very early work in progress though, right?	You know that the company has been pretty early, right?			
最終的なデザインはかなり違ったものになりそうだけど。	The final design is likely to be quite different.	The final design will be pretty different.			
ええ、そのことは伝えてありますし、最終的なデザインがどのような感じになりそうかわかったときに特注治具をデザインすればいいのではと提案していました。	Yes, I made them aware of that, and they suggested we also design a custom jig when we know what the final design will look like.	Yes, I’ve told you about it and it was a proposal that you can feel the final design when you realized how to feel.			
ふむふむ、いい案だな。	Hmm, that's a good idea.	It is a good idea.			
そうなんです、そうすれば、向こうもすぐに生産に入れますね。	Yeah, it would help them get the production started right away.	Yes, if that happens, we will get it in production immediately.			
アサ、君のチームはどうなってる？	Now, Asa, what's been going on in your team?	What's happening with your team, A!			
えー、先週初めの段階で、予定より遅れていたんです。	Well, at the beginning of last week, we fell behind schedule.	Well, at the beginning of the week, I was late than planned.

それで、火曜日に一般客を招いて、いろいろな素材や色の組み合わせを試してもらい、いろいろな特徴も説明しました。	Then, on Tuesday, we invited some members of the public to come and trial the different materials and color combinations, and we explained the various features.	So we have busy customers on Tuesday, and we have to try various types of materials and colors, and we have explained various to various main difference			
すごく貴重なフィードバックももらえたので、デザインチームとも共有しておきました。	We gained some really valuable feedback, which we have shared with the design team.	I got a great feedback, so I shared it with the design team.			
そう、イアンは今日は参加できなかったんだが、その件に関しては繰り返し感謝してたよ。	Yes, Ian couldn't make it today, but he wanted to reiterate how grateful he was for that.	I was able to participate today, but I was grateful to tell you that.			
フィードバックを聞いて、彼もチームも正しい方向に向かっていると確信できたと言ってたし、次に取り掛かるべきことについて指示したそうだ。	He said the feedback gave him and his team confidence that they are moving in the right direction, and has informed them what they need to focus on next.

えーと、皆さんご存知のとおり、商品名についてすごく良いブレーンストーミングのセッションができまして、当社のブランドとコンセプトをとてもよく反映している候補名がいくつか上がりました。	Well, as you all know, we had a great brainstorming session for the product name, and came up with some options that we thought reflected our brand and the concept really well.	Well, as you know, we have a very good breakrooming session on the product name and the concept of our company, and some of the products are very well reflected in our brand name.			
そうか。	Yes.	And yes.			
ですが、残念なことに、一押しだった候補については、既に同じ商品名があるということで、その後法務部から連絡を受けて却下されました。	Unfortunately, the legal team has since got back to us and rejected our number one candidate, as there is already a product with that name.	Unfortunately, we have already have the same product name, and we have the same product, and we have been contacted by the legal department.			
そして、もう一つの有力候補はスペイン語では下品とみなされるようで、振り出しに戻ってしまいました。	Another favorite could apparently be deemed offensive in Spanish, so it looks like it's back to the drawing board.	And another candidates seemed to be considered a discounted product in Spanish, and they returned to the start.			
心配するな、まだ時間はある。	Not to worry, it's still early days.	Don't worry, we still have time.			
さて、この辺で切り上げるとするかな。	Right, let's wrap it up there.	Well, I think I will cut it up in this area.

先方に電話してみるのは？	Why don't you try calling them?	How about I call you first?			
実は担当者さんが今週は国外にいるので、メールに返信もらえるのを期待してたんです。	Actually the person in charge is out of the country this week so I was hoping he'd reply my email.	In fact, the officers were abroad this week, so I thought they would be able to answer the email.			
彼は今ヨーロッパに居て、電話で連絡するのはちょっと難しいんですよ。	He's in Europe right now and it's a bit hard to reach him by phone.	He is in Europe and contacting me on the phone is a bit difficult.			
というか、自分が出張の時に誰から電話かかってきてほしくないんですよね。	I mean, I wouldn't want someone calling me when I'm on a business trip.	I don’t want to call me when I’m on a trip, right?			
特に寝てるときとか。	Especially when I'm sleeping or something.	Especially when you are sleeping.

赤い水性サインペンが欲しいんだけど。	I want a red non-permanent marker.	I want a red water sign.

探してみたんだけど見つからなくって。	I looked for it but didn't find it.	I tried to find it, but it was not found.			
倉庫に在庫があるかもしれない。	We might have some in the storage.	We might have stock in the warehouse.			
すぐに必要？	Do you need it soon?	Do you need it immediately?			
できれば早めに欲しいな。	The sooner the better.	I want it early if possible.

こっちは急ぎじゃないんだけど、ハサミも新しいのが欲しい。	This is no rush, but I would like a new pair of scissors.	I'm not urgent, but I'd like a new one.

うちの会社のエントランスって殺風景ですよね。	Isn't the entrance to our company a little drab?	Our company’s enter the image is a great return.			
掃除はしているけど、シンプル過ぎるっていうか。	It gets cleaned regularly but it is too plain.	I’m cleaning, but it’s too simple.			
まぁ、華やかな感じじゃないよね。	Well, it's definitely not vibrant.	Well, it's not a good idea.			
エントランス入ったら、社名があって応接セットと内線電話だけですからね。	When you come into the entrance, all you see is the company name, the reception furniture, and the telephone.	If you enter the finished shipping, you just have the company name and the internal line phone.			
一応、観葉植物もあるけどね。	Well, a plant is there too.	There is a do not have any send it to the green dot.			
でも、この観葉植物も会社が移転した時に取引先からお祝いで頂いたものですし。	But we got this plant as a gift from our client when our office moved.	But this do not have any problem since the company was transferred, so we celebrateed it from the trading company.			
ちょっと枯れてきちゃっている部分もありますよね。	Some of the leaves are dying though.	There is a little bit of a part of it, right?			
高田さんは、結構色んな会社訪問してるじゃないですか？	Takada-san, you have visited many companies, haven't you?	Do you see a lot of companies?			
印象に残っている会社のエントランスとかあります？	Do you remember any company that has an impressive entrance?	Do you have any impression companies that have left?			
会社の規模によって全然違うから、一概にうちの参考にはならないけど。	Since it varies greatly depending on the size of a company, it might not be very useful.	It is completely different from the scale of the company, so it doesn’t work for us.			
今までで一番インパクトがあったのは、J証券かな。	The most impressive one by far is J brokerage.	The most impact I have ever had is J securities.			
外資系の大手投資銀行だから、全く参考にはならないんだけど。	It is a large international brokerage firm, so it's not helpful to compare though.	It is a foreign funding bank, so it doesn’t matter at all.

外資系ヘッジファンドのH投資顧問かな。	Foreign hedge fund managing company H might be it.	He is an investment consultant for the foreign funding.			
どんな感じでした？	How was it?	How was it?			
日比谷のホテルに隣接しているオフィス棟に入っているんだけど。	It's in a building adjacent to a hotel in Hibiya.	I am in the office building, which is a and the hotel of the village.

生花のアレンジメントを飾るくらいだったら、うちも真似できるじゃないですか？	Can we borrow their idea and add a fresh flower arrangement?	If you are going to be able to make a arrangement, can you copy it too?			
じゃあ、ちょっと片付けて試験的にやってみる？	Then should we straighten up and do it as a trial?	So do you want to clean and try it a little?			
周りの反応を見てみようかな。	Let's see how people react to it.	Let's see the reaction around me.

それに、観葉植物だと長期間置いてもらえますからね。	They also last for a long time.	You can leave it for a long time if it is a thirtietha.			
あと、贈り主の名前が入った立て札を付けたままにしてあると、当社の名前がその会社に訪れた方の目につきますしね。	We can also add a plaque with our company name with the gift which will show their visiting clients our relationship.	And if we have a name of the gift list, we will see the person who has been to the company.

はい、分かりました。	Yes, okay.	Yes, I understand it.			
僕はやはり初回の実験的な輸出であるということから、シンガポールに住む日本人をターゲットとした今日本で販売している商品の輸出が良いのではないかと思います。	I still think the first trial export should target Japanese people living in Singapore and export the products we sell in Japan today would be good.	I think it’s a very interesting export of the Japanese people who live in Singapore because it’s the first time.			
なるほど。	I see.	I see.			
日本人をターゲットにするということで、今ある既存の商品をそのまま輸出することができます。	By targeting Japanese people, we can simply export the existing products that we have.	If we are targeting Japanese people, we can export the existing products as is.			
現地の日本人が集まりやすい場所に販売箇所を絞ることで、経費も削減できると考えます。	If we narrow down our sales point to places where Japanese people tend to gather in the local area, we should be able to reduce our expenses too.	If we narrow the local Japanese people down the sales space that is easy to gather, we think the cost can be reduced.

会社でフードドネーションを募るというのはどうでしょうか？	How about making a food donation as a company.	How about we increase the Food since we're in the company?

かなりの数が集まったと聞きしたよ。	I heard they collected loads of donation.	I heard that there were a lot of people.

そうねー、気遣いができればいいんじゃないかしら？	Well, it would be good if you are attentive.	Yes, I think you should be able to take care of it.			
例えば取り皿が足りない人はいないかとか、お酒がまだ来てない人がいないかとか。	Like making sure everyone has an extra plate or making sure everyone has got their alcohol.	For example, there is no one who has enough a prize, or hasn't there yet been no one here.			
グラスのお酒が減ってきたら足してあげるとか。	Pouring some alcohol in their glass if it's getting less.	If the glasses are reduced, I will give you a little bit.

3分の1とかですか？	Like one third?	Like a third?			
それとも完全にグラスが空になってからですか？	Or when the glass is completely empty?	Or have you ever been completely empty?			
これ人によって好みがいろいろなのよね、私は空になってから派だけど。	People preferences varies but I'm the type that does it when it is empty.	There are a lot of preferences, I’m free.			
特にどれぐらいっていうのはないのよね。	There isn't really a set amount.	How much does it mean?			
1回3分の1ぐらいになった時に注いでみればわかるんじゃない？	You will probably know if you try pouring it once when it is around one third.	Do you know if you try to pay once a third?			
嫌な人なら断るだろうし、そうじゃない人はそのままグラスを差し出すわよ。	People who dislike it will say no and those who are fine will just hand you their glass.	If you don’t like it, you’ll be able to give people who don’t like it.			
でもそこまで細かくグラスに目を光らせなくても気づいた時に注げばいいわよ。	But I don't think you have to be that detailed and attentive, just pour it when you notice it.	But you should just focus on it when you don’t have to look out so much in the glasses.			
なるほど、わかりました。	I see, got it.	I see, I realized it.			
やっぱり部長とか課長の席には率先してお酒を注ぎに行ったほうがいいんでしょうか？	Should I be pouring alcohol to managers or the section chief?	Do you want to go to the seat of the manager and go to the drink?			
まあ1回くらいは行ったほうがいいわね。	I think it would be good to go at least once.	Well, it is better to go once.			
偉い人から順番に回るんですよね？	So I should go around in order in terms of rank?	You are going to turn your great team in order, right?			
そうね、基本は序列順ね。	Yeah, by rank in general.	Yes, the basics are in line.			
明日の会場はどこなの？	Where is the venue tomorrow?	Where is the meeting tomorrow?			
S駅の側のHホテルの宴会場って聞いてます。	I heard it is at the banquet hall of Hotel H beside Station S.	I've heard that the H hotel meeting place on the side of the S station.			
だったら丸テーブルで6名ずつぐらいで座ると思うわ。	Then I think there will be around 6 people sitting around a round table.	I think we will sit on a whole table.			
課長と同じ席になったらそこは序列気にせず課長のを先に注げばいいわ。	If the section chief is sitting with you then you can ignore the rank and just pour it for the section chief first.	If you’re in the same seat as the chief, you should just focus on the manager first.			
それとあそこだとフレンチのコースだから周りのペースに合わせて食べてね。	Also, they serve a French course menu so make sure to eat at a pace that others are eating at.	And that’s the way to eat it according to the pace of the flyers around the area.			
妙に遅かったり早かったりするとマイペースだなって捉えられかねないから。	If you are oddly slow or fast, they may think you are the type that does things at your own pace.	If it was somewhat early, it would not be able to get able to it.			
わかりました、私男兄弟の中で育って食べるのが早いんですけど気をつけます。	Okay, I grew up with older and younger brothers so I eat fast but I will be careful.	I know, I’m going to grow up in my men’s brother and eat quickly, but I’m			
最後にくれぐれもこれだけは覚えておいて。	Finally, be sure to remember this by all means.	Do you remember this much?			
新入社員歓迎会だけではなくて今後会社の飲み会では酔っ払いすぎないこと。	Be sure to not get too drunk not just for new employee welcome party but for future company drinking parties.	Not only for the new employees, but for the drinking party, the company will be too drunk in the future.			
酔っ払いすぎると自分が気づかないうちに変わってしまう人もいるから。	There are people who completely change without realizing when they get too drunk.	Some people might change even if they don't realize them.			
はい、アドバイスありがとうございます。	Okay, thank you for your advice.	Yes, thank you for the advice.			
でもあそこの伊勢海老のクリームソースは最高よ、楽しんできてね！	But their lobster cream sauce is awesome, have fun!	But that's the best way to eat, and enjoy it!			
これはこれは谷中先生、いつもお世話になってます。	Hello Yanaka san, it's a pleasure, as always.	This is Tanimoto-san, I'm always taking care of you.			
社長、こちらこそいつもお世話になっております。	Hello Miyajima san, the pleasure is all mine.	Mr. CEO, I am always taking care of you.			
今日は健康診断についてちょっとお話ししたかったものでお伺いしました。	Today, I wanted to discuss the health examination situation with you.	I wanted to talk a little about health diagnosis today.			
そうか、社員に健康診断を受けさせないといけないんだよね。	Oh yes, we need to provide medical examinations for our employees.	Yes, you have to make employees get health examinations.			
そうなんですよ、これは労働安全衛生法で義務付けられているんです。	That's right, it is mandated by the Labor Safety and Health Act.	Yes, this is mandatory for work safety health law.			
長時間労働での健康障害が増えてるので、かなり厳しくなっていますね。	It's very strict now that there's been an increase in health disorders due to long working hours.	It’s hard to get health in the long-term work.			
よしわかった、やろう。	Alright, then we must get this in order.	Alright, let's do it.			
会社指定の病院で受けさせればいいんだっけ？	Do we send them to one of the company approved hospitals?	Should I get it at a company’s shipping hospital?			
それもひとつの方法としてありますね。	That is one option.	It is also a way to do that.			
あとは、会社で集団健診を実施か従業員各自に受診させてその結果を提出させるかです。	Or the company can organize a group health examination, or allow each employee to take an exam and submit results.	Then, let's make sure that we will look at the company and submit the results to the employees.			
いろいろあるんだね、うちはどれがいいんだろうか？	I see, there are many options, which would you recommend?	There are a lot, which one would we be better?			
御社であれば、加入してあるG県健保組合の指定医療機関での受診が望ましいですね。	I recommend using one of the G prefectural health insurance association approved medical institutions for your company.	If you are a member of the G- your company, it is desirable to be able to see the health care organization in the G- two of			
一番手間がかからずにできる方法です。	That would be the easiest option.	It's the best way to do it without being able to do it.			
それって健保組合の指定した医療機関じゃないとダメなのかい？	Would it have to be a medical institution approved by the health insurance association?	Is that a health care organization that has been great enough?			
そうですね、原則そうなります。	As a general rule, yes.	Yes, it will be the rules.			
実はうちのクライアントにL病院があってね。	We have an L hospital as our client.	In fact, our customers have a L hospital.			
できたらそこで受けさせたらいいんじゃないかと思ったわけよ。	I was hoping we can use the hospital, if possible.	I thought it would be good if you could get it there.			
今リストを持っていますので調べてみます。	Let's see, I will check the list right now.	I'm going to check it now.			
うーん、L病院ですね。	Well, L hospital is...	Hmm, it's a L hospital.			
残念ながらリストには入っていないようですね。	Unfortunately is not on the list.	Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be on the list.			
そうか、ここで受けさせるにはどうしたらいいかな？	Hum, how can we use this hospital?	So, what should I do to get it here?			
この健康診断は会社が全ての費用を負担しないといけません。	The company would have to cover the costs for the health examinations.	This health diagnosis must be charged for all costs.			
なので私がL病院に事前に話をして社員さんから費用徴取をしないように伝えます。	I can contact L hospital and tell them not to charge the fees from the employees ahead of time.	So I will tell the employees not to receive the cost item from their employees in advance.			
ただ各自に受診させるので健康診断の必要項目以外を受診希望することもあります。	There might be incidences where they might request something other than what's required when the exams are done individually.	You can only make them look at them, so you can see them except for health check.			
例えばどういうケース？	Can you give me an example?	What case is it?			
バリウムではなく胃カメラ検査を希望したりするケースですね。	For example, in a case when an employee chooses a gastroscopy procedure, rather than taking barium.	It is a case that wants to eat stomach camera testing rather than bar sure.			
この差額でプラス2万円になったりすることもあります。	The cost difference will be an additional 20,000 yen.	This difference will make you 2 blocks and 2 blocks.			
なるほどね。	I see.	I see.			
その場合はオプションになることを事前に社員さんに伝えておく必要があります。	We would need to inform the employees in advance that there are different options.	In that case, you need to tell the employees in advance that the option will be.			
私の方で、健康診断のお知らせのようなものを作りましょう。	I will draw up a memo for the health exam.	Let me create something like a health diagnosis.			
よろしく、頼んだよ。	That would be great, thank you.	Thank you, I asked you.			
受ける時期は皆一緒じゃないといけないのかい？	Would we need to get all of them to take the exam around the same time?	Do you have to be together the time you receive?			
なかなか現場の都合もあって、皆一緒には難しいと思うんだよね。	I think it will be difficult for all of them to go around the same time due to site constraints.	It’s a good idea for the scene, so everyone is hard to go together.			
それは構いませんよ、皆さんで揃えなくても問題ありません。	I  agree and  they won't need to do it at the same time.	It doesn’t matter, but it doesn’t have to be made.			
それとこれは法律上、受診時間中の賃金支払い義務はありません。	Also, it is not required by law to pay employees during the examination.	And this is the job of payment in the legal time.			
ただし、労働時間として取り扱い、賃金を支払うことが望ましいとされています。	But it is recommended that the company treat that time as work, and provide pay.	However, it is desirable to deal with work hours and pay wages.			
社員からすれば、会社からの命令で健康診断に行くという形になりますので。	Most employees consider it as a company requirement that they do the exam.	From employees, it will be a form to go to health diagnosis from the company.			
わかった、勤務時間扱いにしよう。	I understand, we will treat it as working hours.	I know, let’s take care of the work time.			
では私は健康診断のお知らせができましたらまたご連絡します。	OK, I will let you know when I prepare the memo for the health exam.	If I have a health diagnosis, I will contact you again.			
ご苦労さん、よろしく頼むよ。	That would be great, thank you.	Thank you, please.			
新人だからってどうして電話を率先して取らなくちゃいけないんですか？	Just because we're new, why do we have to take the initiative in picking up calls?	Why do you need to take the phone first?			
手が空いている人が取ればいいだけじゃないですか。	Why can't whoever is available pick it up?	You just need someone who is empty.			
確かにそうですね。	That's true.	That's right.			
でも率先して電話を出る事によって先様に新しい人が入ったんだなと名前を覚えてもらえます。	But if you take the initiative and pick up, it will be a chance for the other party to know that a new person joined and to remember your name.	But you can remember the name that the new person has been in the company by being on the phone.			
そして電話対応が良いとあなたの評価が回りまわって社外からも社内からも上がります。	And if the way you handled the call was good, your reputation will get better from outside and inside the company.	And if your phone response is well, your assessment will be went around and will increase within the company.			
おお、それはいいですね。	Oh, that'd be nice.	Oh, that is good.			
ということで、電話対応お願いしますね。	So, please do pick up the calls.	So please respond to the phone.			
ではどうして僕たちが資料集めや必要な情報の選定をしなくてはいけないんですか？	Then why is it that we have to gather reference materials and pick out information?	So why do we need to collect and select the documents and documents we need to select?			
これは作家先生本人がするべきことですよね？	Isn't this something that the author should do?	This is what the writer should do, right?			
そうですね、アマチュアの作家さんはもちろんプロの作家先生でも自分でされる方はおられます。	Well, there are amateur authors and of course professional authors who do it themselves.	Yes, the one who is an amateur assistant, of course, will be able to do it myself.			
でも私は作家先生に今目の前にある物語に集中してほしい。	But I want the author to focus on the story in front of them now.	But I want the writer to focus on the floor right in front of you.			
資料集めは地味に時間がかかるものです。	Gathering reference materials does take some time to do.	The material is a bit difficult to find.			
だからその時間を執筆に使ってほしいと、私は思っています。	So, I'd rather have the author spend that time writing.	So I think I want to use that time to write.			
それに違う目線で資料を集め選定することは、作家先生の想像力を刺激する事にも繋がります。	Also, gathering materials and picking out the information from a different perspective can bring about a new idea for the author too.	Then, if you select the documents on the different line, you will also be able to back to that you will back to back			
ただ資料を集めるだけじゃないんです。	So it's not just simply gathering materials.	Not just get the documents.			
そういった事も編集者の仕事だと、私は考えています。	I believe that things like that are part of an editor's job.	I think that these things are the email that is the happen.			
なるほど、そういう意味もあるんですね。	I see, there is such a meaning behind that too.	I see, that's what it means.			
ありがとうございます、佐々木さん。	Thank you very much Sasaki-san.	Thank you, Megumu.			
木檜さん、おはようございます！	Good morning, Satoru!	Good Morning, Mr. Kinononoki!			
おお、ピーターソンさん、朝から随分元気だね。	Hi, Ron, you're pretty hyper today.	Mr. Peterson, you are very well from the morning.			
なんかあったの？	What's up?	Has something happened?			
今度ウチの生体認証センサーがテレビに出るって知ってる？	Have you heard that our biometric sensor will be on TV soon?	Do you know that our bio your turn on television this time?			
ああ、なんかそんな事誰かが言ってたっけ。	Ah, I've heard someone was saying something about that, I guess.	Oh, someone like that said it.			
木曜夜にやってるT放送のニュース番組に出るんだ。	We'll be on the news show for T Station every Thursday night.	I'm going to go on the news show on the T- quite late on Thursday night.			
あの番組の中で「今週の最先端技術」って紹介するコーナーあるじゃない？	You know "State of the Art Technology of the Week" section in that show, don't you?	There is a section that will be introducing this week’s newest technology, right?			
あ、それ私も結構見てますよ！	Oh, I watch that quite often, too!	Oh, I’m looking at that too!			
ああ、そういえばこの間、AI使ったサイバー攻撃防御システムとかってF株式会社が取り上げられてたな。	Oh, yeah, F Corporation was on that show the other day, showing their cyber security system that uses AI or something.	Oh, by the way, the self- different from the self- different from the self- different from the self that we used for the self- different			
そうね、あの時出てたFの人、話が上手かったわ。	That's right, that person from F was pretty good at talking.	Yes, the F person who was at that time was good.			
実はあのコーナーって、一発撮りなんだって。	I've heard that section is actually shot in one go.	In fact, that corner is a single picture.			
えー、でも結構突っ込んだ質問とかしてくるよね？	Wow, but they often ask some sharp questions, don't they?	Well, you’re going to ask a lot of questions, right?			
この研究所って、機密保持契約のプロジェクト多いから何言うか気を付けないとだね。	This laboratory has quite a few of projects with non-disclosure agreement, so we have to be careful what we say, huh?	This laboratory is a lot of projects for a confidentiality contract, so you need to be careful.			
ウチのラボからは誰が出るの？	Who's going to be on the show from our lab?	Who will leave our lab?			
多分長澤さんじゃないかな。	I guess Kaname would be the one.	Maybe it is a long-term choice.			
彼、開発部長だし。	He's our Chief of the Development, too.	He is the development manager.			
あのセンサーの事一番良く知ってるでしょ。	And he knows everything about our sensor.	You know the best about that sensors.			
彼なら安心してテレビの前に座ってられるね。	Then I can relax in front of the TV if he'll be on air.	He can sit down before the TV.			
あ、噂をすれば...。	Oh, speaking of the devil...	Oh, if you hear rumors...			
長澤さん、おはようございます！	Good morning, Kaname!	Mr. Shiva, good morning!			
おはよう。	Good morning.	Good Morning.			
みんな朝から集まって何の話？	What are you all chatting about gathering together?	What are you talking about from the morning?			
私は仲間はずれなのかな？	Am I missing on something here guys?	I wonder if I'm out of work.			
いえ長澤さん、ウチのセンサーがテレビで紹介されるって話をしてたんです。	Well, we were just talking about our sensor being introduced on TV, Kaname.	Mr. Shiva, I was talking about our sensors on TV.			
ああ、あれか、みんな耳が早いね。	Oh, that, you guys have sharp ears, huh?	Oh, that one, everyone listens quickly.			
長澤さん、それっていつ放送されるんですか？	When is it going to be on air, Kaname?	When will it be shipped?			
うーん、３週間くらい先のオンエアだったかな。	I think it'll be on about three weeks from now.	Hmm, it was about three weeks ago.			
もう撮ったんですか？	Have they shot already?	Have you already taken it?			
いや、来週火曜日の午後のはずだ。	Not yet, it's supposed to be next Tuesday afternoon.	No, it should be on Tuesday afternoon.			
テレビ局の撮影班がここに来るよ。	A camera crew is coming here from the TV station.	The team of TV travel team will come here.			
うわー、何処で撮るんですか？	Wow, where are they shooting?	Where do you take it?			
第一会議室だと思うよ。	I believe they'll shoot it in Meeting Room 1.	I think it's the first meeting room.			
先方がなるべく広くて明るい部屋がいい、って言ってたからね。	They said they'd prefer a spacious room with lots of light.	They said that the rooms are wide and bright.			
じゃあ、ボードとか少し片付けた方がいいですか？	Well then, should we put away some of the stuff like the whiteboard in the room?	So, do you want me to clean the board or a little?			
大丈夫だよ、いつも通りが良いらしいから。	It's okay, they want to shoot in our usual setting.	It’s okay, it’s as usual.			
散らかってる研究室じゃなくて良かったね。	I'm relieved that they won't go into the messy lab.	It's not a waste laboratory.			
あー、なんでよりによってその日なんだ、僕出張なのにー！	Argh, why does it have to be on that day, I'll be gone on a business trip!	Oh, why is that day, it's a trip!			
ピーターソンさん、撮影関係ないでしょ。	You have nothing to do with shooting, though.	Peterson, it doesn't matter to take a picture.			
だって、あのレポーターの女の子、ファンなんだよ！	Well, I'm a fan of that reporter girl!	I'm a fan of that forgot to hear from the happen!			
お喋りしたいのは分かるけど、みんなあと10分で朝ミーティング、始めるよ。	I know you want to chat a bit more, but we have a morning meeting in 10 minutes, all right?	I know you want to talk, but everyone will start a morning meeting in 10 minutes.			
じゃ、今朝のミーティングはこれくらいかな？	Well, so that's about it for the morning meeting today?	So, is this much this the meeting this morning?			
あ、あと１点だけ、確認させてください。	Oh, I'd like to confirm one more thing.	Oh, just one more thing, please.			
来週のテレビ取材ですけど、どのセンサー出すんですか？	About the TV coverage next week, which sensor are we showing them?	This is the next week’s TV interview, but which sensors will you be going to give?			
社長は最新のやつ出したがったんだけど...。	Well, Kentaro wanted to put out the latest ones, but....	The president wanted to get the most advanced one...			
静脈認証のはまだテスト完全に終わってないですよ？	We haven't completed testing for the one with vein authentication yet, you know?	The  five percent of the nothing but our nothing but our nothing but our nothing but our nothing			
ウチの３D顔認証の方はまだ開発中だし。	We're still developing 3D sensors for face recognition, too.	Our 3d, we are still under development.			
だから、今F社のSフォンに乗せてる虹彩認証センサーを見せる事にしたんだよ。	So, we've decided to show our iris authentication sensor currently mounted on F Corporation's S phone.	So I decided to show a many IPO confirmation sensors that are now on the F company’s S.			
最新のセンサーに関しては、ちょっと最後に話入れるくらいが安全かなって。	As for our latest sensors, it's probably safer to mention a little at the end of the coverage.	With the latest sensors, it is a bit safer to get in the end.			
ふー、あの指紋認証の時みたいになったらって、心配してたんです。	Phew, I was worried if something went wrong like that time with that fingerprint sensor.	I was worried if it was like that time for fingerprint recognition.			
私はまだトラウマですよ。	I still carry that trauma, you know?	I am still very solid.			
あーあれはヤバかった、生放送の番組だったしね。	Oh, that was chilling, and it was a live show, too!	Oh, that was a crazy, it was a live program.			
私、何の話か分からないんですけど。	I don't know what you guys are talking about.	I don’t know what to say.			
指紋認証、ですか？	About fingerprint authentication?	fingerprint recognition?			
ああ、かなり前の話だから三居さんはまだ居なかったかも。	Oh, yeah, it was quite a while ago so maybe you weren't around then, Anna.	Oh, it's a long time, so three of them may not be here yet.			
10年くらい前でしたっけ？	About 10 years ago, I believe?	Was it about 10 years ago?			
そう、当時ウチが開発したばかりの指紋認証センサー、今回みたいなテレビ番組が取り上げられたんだけど。	Yes, like this time, a TV show covered our fingerprint recognition sensor which we had just developed at the time.	Yes, our fingerprint recognition sensors that we have only developed at the time was taken by a show like this.			
残念ながら、生放送の取材中にちゃんと作動しなくてね、その場でフォローも出来なくて。	Unfortunately, it didn't work out properly during the live report, and we couldn't cover for the trouble on the fly either.	Unfortunately, it didn’t work well during the interview of the live interview, so I couldn’t follow it there.			
そう、それでこの研究所の評判ガタ落ちして、回復すんのに数年かかったんだ！	Yeah, this lab's reputation took a nosedive then, and we had to spend few years to recover!	Yes, so it took a few years to recover it!			
あの時も大塚社長が一番新しいの出したいって言ったんだよね。	Kentaro insisted that he'd show the latest product at the time as well.	At that time, the president of O tell you that the new company.			
今回と違って、説得しきれなくて。	Unlike this time, I couldn't convince him not to.	Unlike this time, I can’t convince you.			
でも、あれは田淵所長がセンサーの使い方も良く知らないのに色々触りまくってたのが大きな要因だよね。	But I think the big part of it was that Toru fiddled around with the sensor, even though he didn't know much about how to use it.	But it is a great thing that Tanibu every once the manager does not know how to use sensors, but it is a great thing to touch.			
あの人、研究所所長っていっても、肩書きだけの元お役人でしょ？	He's the director of this laboratory, but just a figurehead, a retired official, isn't he?	He is the head of the lab, but he is the former representative, right?			
おいおい、言葉に気を付けなさいよ、ピーターソン君。	Whoa, you should watch your mouth, Ron.	Hey, be careful on your words, Peterson.			
だって真面目な話、田淵さん色々わかってないプロジェクトにいっつも口出して、迷惑かけるんですもん。	Well, seriously, he always intervenes in projects he doesn't really understands, and gets us into troubles.	If you’re serious, Mr. Tanii road is always going to tell me a lot of projects that you don’t understand, and it’s hard to trouble.			
先週だって僕のF社でのプレゼン見るって、ついて来たんですけど。	Last week too, Toru followed me to see my presentation at F Corporation, though.	I tried to see my presentation at Company F last week.			
いらん事ばっかり言うから、後から全部細々説明しなきゃいけなくて、スゴく余計な時間かかったんですよ。	He just kept telling them unnecessary things, so I had to spend so much extra time to follow up with explanations for each and every aspect.	I have to explain everything from the end, so it takes a lot of time.			
あー、それ私も先月の展示会でやられたわー！	Oh, he did that to me, too, at an exhibition last month!	Oh, I did it at the exhibition last month!			
全部知ってるフリして来場者に話しちゃうでしょ？	He spoke to participants as if he knew everything, you know?	You will do not do it all, right?			
ずっと気にして横からフォローいれなきゃいけなくて、ほんと疲れた!	I had to be on the watch and cover for him throughout the event, made me super exhausted!	I have to worry about it all the time and follow up!			
表に出て話したいなら、もう少し勉強してからにして欲しいよねー。	He should learn more about our products if he wants to go speak in public.	If you want to go out to the table, you want to learn a little more.			
まあまあ、みんなちょっと落ち着いて、そんなに彼を責めないで。	Well, everybody, calm down a bit, don't be so hard on him.	Well, everyone is a little calm and don't blame him so much.			
田淵さんも今度はちゃんとやろうって考えているみたいだから、きっと大丈夫だよ。	Toru is thinking of how he'd do better this time, so he should be okay.	Mr. Taniii san seems to be trying well this time, so it’s okay.			
え、ちょっと待ってください、大丈夫って何がですか？	Wait, wait a sec, what do you mean he'd be okay?	Oh, wait a little, what does it mean?			
あれ、さっき皆話してたでしょ？	Well, you were all talking about it, weren't you?	Oh, you guys talked to them right now, right?			
テレビに出るって、田淵さんが。	About Toru's appearance, on TV.	Mr. Taniiiry will be on TV.			
まさか、今回の虹彩認証センサーも田淵所長が出るんじゃあないですよね？	You're not saying that Toru will be on the show this time with our iris recognition sensor, are you?	Oh, you don’t think the sensors for this time will be the head of the department, right?			
そうだよ、知らなかったの？	Yes, you didn't know?	Yes, did you not know?			
いやいや、それは絶対無理ですって！	No, no, no, that's definitely impossible!	No, that’s never possible!			
イヤだ、あんな悪夢はもう嫌だー！	No, way, no more of that nightmare!	No, I don't like that bad any more!			
所長、今度はラボ全体をトラウマに陥れる気なんですか？	Is he trying to traumatize the whole Lab now?	Do you want to get into the entire lab trouble?			
では、本日の会議を始めます。	Hello everyone, let's get started with today's meeting.	We will begin the meeting today.			
岡田と申します。	My name is Okada.	My name is Okada.			
よろしくお願い致します。	Nice to meet you all.	Please please.			
今日は第1回目の会議ですので、まずは簡単にそれぞれの自己紹介をしましょう。	Since this is our first meeting, let's begin with a quick introduction around the table.	Today is the first meeting, so let’s first make it easy to introduce yourself.			
その後、私から今回のプロジェクトの概要を簡単にお話しします。	Then, I am going to give you a brief introduction of our new project.	Then I will tell you a quick shipping summary of this project.			
私はこのプロジェクト期間チームを主導させて頂きます。	I am going to be leading this team for the duration of this project.	I will take the team for this project.			
普段は営業1課におります。	I normally work at unit one in the Sales Department.	We usually go to the business class.

よろしくお願い致します。	It's nice meeting you all today.	Please please.			
次に岸田さん、自己紹介をお願いできますか？	Would you like to introduce yourself next, Ms. Kishida?	Next, can you present yourself?			
はい。	Sure.	and yes.			
皆さんはじめまして、岸田です。	Nice to meet you all, I'm Kishida.	Congratulations to you, I am Ta.			
普段は営業2課におります。	I am at unit two in the Sales Department.	We usually go to sales two.			
みなさんと一緒に働けるのを楽しみにしています。	I look forward to working with you all.	I look forward to working with you all.			
岸田さん、よろしくお願い致します。	Nice meeting you too, Ms. Kishida.	Mr. Swan, please.			
私は宮本です。	My name is Miyamoto.	I am Mr. Mahmoud.			
普段は販売促進部におります。	I work in the Sales Promotion Department.	We usually go to the sales department.			
お二人と共に働けることが楽しみです。	I look forward to collaborating with you both.	I am looking forward to working with you both.			
それではこの新プロジェクトの概要について話します。	We are now going to talk about the outline of this project.	Let me talk about the summary of this new project.			
今回の新プロジェクトの狙いは我が社の新決済システムの新規利用先の開拓です。	The new project aims to identify new users for our payment settlement system.	This project is the development of our new payment system.			
さらに、想定できる利用先とは異なる新しい利用者も獲得することが狙いです。	Furthermore, we are also looking at extending our services to new types of users from our list of sales leads.	Also, it is also trying to get new users that are different from the expected use.			
新しい利用者というと？	What exactly do you mean by new type of users?	What is a new user?			
良いご質問ですね、通常の小売店や飲食店だけではなくその他にもということです。	Good question, it means we are aiming to attract not only retail shops or restaurants but also any other potential opportunities.	It is not only good for regular retail and food, but also other.			
なるほど。	I see.	I see.			
そうですか。	Ok.	Yes is?			
様々な利用先を獲得したいということですね。	We want to get various type of users.	You want to get various use.			
その通りです。	That's right.	It is right.			
だからそれぞれ違う営業部署や担当からプロジェクトチームが構成されたんですね。	That's why our team comprises different sales departments and divisions.	So each of them was made by different sales teams and projects.			
その通りです。	Exactly.	It is right.			
各部署や各課での営業スタイルは違うと思いますが、それが強みになります。	Each department or unit has a different marketing strategy, and that would be our strength.	I think that’s different from each department and each department, but that’s a strength.			
そうですね。	Yes.	Yes is.			
是非、このプロジェクトを成功させましょう。	Let's make this project a success.	We will definitely succeed this project.			
はい、一緒に頑張りましょう！	Yes, let's try our best!	Yes, let’s work hard together!			
もちろん数値目標があるのですが、その点については次回詳しく説明します。	Of course we will have a revenue target, but we will go into that more in our next meeting.	Of course, we have a increased goal, but I will explain it in detail.			
とりあえず、今日は時間があまりないので終わります。	Anyway, we should close the meeting here as we are running out of time.	Well, we don't have much time today.			
次回の会議スケジュールと資料を後程Eメールでお送りします。	I'll email you the schedule for the next meeting and the supplemental documents later.	I will send you the next meeting schedule and documents later.			
はい、承知致しました。	Yes, noted.	Yes, I realized it.			
はい、お願い致します。	Yes, please.	Yes, please.			
カナさん、ちょっとお聞きしていいですか？	Hi Kana, can I ask you something?	Can you ask me a little?			
うん。	Sure.	and yes.			
日本に船便で身の回り品を送りたいと言っている学生さんがいるんです。	There is a student who wants to send his personal belongings to Japan by sea.	There are students who say they want to send their own products on shipping flight to Japan.			
来月出国予定で、昨日事務所に質問に来ました。	He's leaving the country next month, and he came to the office yesterday asking for advice.	I was planning to go out next month and I came to the office yesterday.			
普段荷物を送るのにはY社を使っていると思うんですが、今朝電話で見積もりをお願いしたら1000ポンド以上かかると言われたんです。	I understand that we usually use Company Y for the shipment, but when I called them this morning to get a quote, they basically told me it would cost more than 1000 pounds.	I think it will take more than $1,000 to send the usual package, but if you call me this morning, it will take more than $1,000.			
学生さんの予算をかなりオーバーしているので、他のやり方がないか探しているんですよね。	Since that is way out of his budget, I am trying to find other ways of doing it.	I'm quite over the student's budget so I'm looking for something else.			
なるほど。	Right.	I see.			
Y社は手続きを一つのパッケージプランでやってくれるから便利なんだけど、その分ちょっと割高になりがちなんだよね。	Company Y offers the service as one whole package, and while it is very convenient, it tends to be a bit overpriced.	Y company will do the process in one package plan, but it is a bit expensive.			
もし自分たちで国内の船会社と、日本で通関業者と運送会社をそれぞれ見つけられれば合計の費用は安く済むはず。	If we can find a shipping company here, and a custom broker and a delivery company in Japan separately by ourselves the total fee should be cheaper.	If we find our own shipping company and the shipping company in Japan, the total will be cheaper.			
なるほど。	I see.	I see.			
何年か前に同じような案件があったよ。	We had a similar case a few years ago.	There was a similar case a few years ago.			
確かここに記録があったような、ちょっと待ってね。	I think I can find the record here, give me a sec.	It seems that there was a record here, wait a little.			
ありがとうございます。	Thanks.	Thank you.			
あった。	Here it is.	Here it is.			
貨物の引き取りと日本の港への送付はW社にお願いして、税関業務はE社にお願いして、そしたら輸送もE社が手配してくれているね。	We asked Company W to collect the cargo and ship to the Japanese Port in Tokyo, then for the custom paperwork we asked Company E and they arranged the delivery for us as well.	The shipping and sending the shipping to the port of Japan to the W company, and the customs work will be ordered to the company and the shipping company.			
費用は全部で500ポンド。	The total fee was 500 pounds.	The cost is 500 thousand.			
もちろん、費用の部分は貨物のサイズや重量と、あと内容物の価値によって変わってくる。	Obviously, the fee will change depending on the size and the weight of the cargo as well as the value of the contents.	Of course, the cost will change according to the size of the cargo and the weight and the content value.			
この時には関税はかからないですんだから良かった。	We could avoid getting any custom charge for this case, so that was good.	It's good that we don't have any tariffs at this time.			
その学生さんはどのぐらいの量送ろうと思ってるのかな？	How much stuff is he going to send?	How much do you think the student will send?			
この方と同じぐらいの量のはずです。	It should be about the same as hers.	It should be about the same amount as this one.			
オッケー、まあもちろん全く同じ金額になるとは限らないけど、今回も前回と同じように進めていいと思う。	Ok, well obviously we shouldn't expect it to be exactly the same, but I'd say we can do it in the same way this time.	Ok, I don't know if it will be the same amount, but I think it will be the same as the last time.			
そうですね、W社に電話します。	Yeah, I will call Company W.	Yes, I will call the company W.			
荷物のだいたいの量と内容の価値を聞かれると思うから、学生さんに先に確認した方がいいかもね。	They would need a rough amount of the package and a value of the contents so maybe check with the student first.	I think it’s better to check the value of the content and the student.			
あっ、そうですね。	Ah, yes.	Oh yeah yeah yeah.			
メールします。	I will email him.	I will email you.			
そうだ、W社はもしかしたらCMSを導入したかもしれないから、聞いておいた方がいいよ。	Oh, also Company W may have introduced CMS so check that with them too.	Yes, Company W may have introduced us to C years, so you should ask them.			
CMSって何ですか？	What is CMS?	What is Cms?			
「コンテナー・マネジメント・サーチャージ」っていうんだけど。	It's "container management surcharge".	I'm saying “Ce our container management “ made.”			
実際ちゃんとした費用なのかはわからない部分もあるんだけど、船会社によっては港で荷下ろしするときに通関業者に請求する所があるみたいなんだよね。	It is a little unclear if that is really a thing, but some shipping companies charge the broker when they unload the cargos at the port.	I don’t know if it’s a good cost, but it’s like there’s a place to pay for the shipping in the port.			
手数料みたいなものかな。	It's like a handling fee.	It is like a fee.			
なるほど。	I see.	I see.			
前回W社からは請求されなかったから、今回も同じだといいんだけど。	Company W did not charge us the last time so hopefully it still is the case.	The last time I didn’t get charged from the company W, so it’s the same.			
そうですね。	Yeah.	Yes is.			
前の時のファイルを送っていただいてもいいですか？	Can I ask you to send me the file of the previous case?	Can I send you the file before?			
目を通したいです。	I want to go through it.	I want to see.			
もちろん。	Of course.	of course.			
というか、匿名にして共有のデータベースにあげておくね。	Actually, I am going to make it anonymous and upload it on our shared database.	I will give it to the shared database.			
これからも同じような案件が出てくるかもしれないし。	We may have similar cases in the future.	We may have a similar case from now on.

お手伝いできて嬉しいです！	I'm glad I could help!	I am glad to help you!			
どんなプレゼンにするつもりですか？	What are you planning?	What do you plan to make?			
スライドショーをしようかと考えています。	I'm thinking about using a slide show.	I'm trying to make a slide show.			
我が社の購買層を示すのには円グラフが良いですよね。	I'll probably include a pie chart showing our demographic.	It is a yen graph to show our purchasing class.			
そして地域別の販売高を示すのに棒グラフを使おうと思います。	Then I'll use a bar graph to show our numbers for each region.	We will use a various chart to show the local sale.			
グラフはただ見せるより説明した方が良いですよ。	I would suggest explaining the graph rather than just showing.	You should explain the graph rather than just show it.			
それぞれの座標軸がなにを意味するのか忘れずに指し示してくださいね。	Be sure to point out what each axis means.	Do not forget to show your finger on what your does mean.			
そうすれば、あなたが説明したいことを皆さんが確実に理解してくれます。	That way, you can make sure everyone understands what you're trying to show.	That way, you will definitely understand what you want to explain.			
それから、グラフの各領域の色を目立つようにすること。	Also, make sure the colors between the sections of the graph stand out easily.	Then make the color of each area of the graph clearly.			
でも、あまり派手すぎないように。	Don't make it too fancy, though.	But don't be too hard.			
ごくシンプルにした方が良いですよ。	It's better to keep it pretty simple.	It is better to make it very simple.			
はい！	Okay!	Yes!			
分かりました。	That makes sense.	I understood.			
この題目はどうでしょうか？	How does this theme look?	What about the topic?			
これはちょっと複雑すぎますね。	That one is a bit too complicated.	This is a bit complicated.			
表示の内容が読みにくいです。	It's hard to read what the labels say.	It's hard to read the content of the coffee.			
代わりにこうしてみたら良いと思います。	I think you should try this one instead.	I hope you can do this instead.			
ありがとうございます。	Thanks.	Thank you.			
プレゼン自体についてなにか秘訣はありますか？	Do you have any tips for the actual presentation?	Do you have any secret to what you have about the presentation itself?			
事前に何度か練習することでしょうか。	I would say practice a few times before.	How many times are you planning to practice in advance?			
前日に練習してストレスを感じるより、何日か余裕を持って練習したほうが良いですよ。	Space out your practice between a few days, so you won't be too stressed by practicing on the last day.	It is better to practice on the day before and practice a few days and have a lot more days.			
ナーバスになりすぎず、ホワイトボードを見ずに会場を見渡すようにすること。	Just don't be too nervous, and make sure to look around the room rather than at the white board.	It's not too much for a me to be able to look at the white board.			
プレゼンを暗記すればするほど、簡単に皆さんと目線を合わせられるようになりますよ。	The more you have your presentation memorized, the easier it will be to make eye contact with people.	If you write the presentation, the easier you can make your eyes.			
ちゃんと練習します。	I'll be sure to practice.	I will practice well.			
その点を一番心配しているんです。	That's the part I'm most worried about.	I am the most worried about that.
