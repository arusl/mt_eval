今日は調査の進め方についてトレーニングします。	I will be teaching you how to conduct research today.	Today we are training how to proceed with the research.	85
オンライン調査みたいなものですか？	Like just searching online?	Like online research?	100
それも含みます。	Yes and no.	It will also contain it.	100
まず、出所が正規のところであるかどうか確認しないといけません。	First of all we need to make sure the sources are legitimate.	"First, we need to make sure if the source is a regular place."	60
ブログとかコラムなどはだめということですか？	So no blogs or editorial?	Do you not want blogs or comments?	70
そのとおり。	Exactly.	That's right.	100
最初に見るところは政府のホームページです。	The first place I would look at is government websites.	The first thing you see is the government website.	80
政府の数字は、一般的に正確で信用性が高いものです。	They typically have accurate data that is trustworthy.	"The number of government is high, accurately and."	30
他に良いサイトは？	What other websites would be good?	What is the good site?	40
大手の銀行、会計事務所、市場調査会社などの企業データも活用できます。	"You can also check out major institutions like banks, accounting companies, and market research companies."	"We can also use major banks, accounting offices, market research companies."	90
どうしてですか？	Why those?	Why is it?	90
こうした企業は有名で、たいてい質の良い市況報告を発行しています。	They are well known and typically publishes good market reports.	These companies are famous and usually issued a good market report.	100
でも、市況報告は無料でないこともあります。	But some market reports aren't free.	But the market report is not free.	85
なので、無料データで探します。	So stick to the ones that are free.	So we'll find it for free data.	70
でも、もし、有料データで良さそうなのがあったら？	What if it seems the report is useful?	But if you think you can be able to pay data?	30
私に相談してください。	You can consult with me then.	Please consult me.	90
でも、君がやるのはほとんど予備調査だよ。	But a lot of the research you will be doing is preliminary research.	But it's almost a reserve research you do.	30
経営陣に見せるような調査ではありません。	So it won't be presented to upper management.	It's not an research that we will show to the management.	90
わかりました。	I see.	I realized.	70
市況報告書を購入するようなケースはあるのですか？	Would there be cases when we would purchase market reports?	Do you have a case that will be buying a market report?	90
詳しい実現可能性調査をするようなときには購入が必要になります。	We will need them when we conduct detailed feasibility studies.	When you are going to buy a product that will be in detail.	70
そういう調査は上層部へ報告されるので、専門の第３者企業に認証された情報でなければなりません。	These will be presented to the upper management so we need to show that the information is validated by professional third-party companies.	This investigation should be certified by the three companies.	10
わかりました。	Got it.	I realized.	70
ベンさん、こんにちは、またお会いできて嬉しいです。	"Hi Ben, it's nice to see you again."	"Hi Ben, I am glad to see you again."	100
こちらこそお会いできて嬉しいです。	Nice to see you as well.	I am glad to see you here.	70
ビジネスの方はいかがですか。	Business has been good?	How about business?	90
休暇のシーズンでちょっと活気がないですが、それが普通です。	It's been a bit slow with the holiday season but that's normal.	"There is no bit of fun in the season, but that is normal."	60
今日はお越しいただいてありがとうございます。	Again thank you for coming in today.	Thank you for coming today.	100
先週送って頂いた提案についてお話したかったんです。	I wanted to discuss the proposal you sent me last week.	I wanted to talk about the proposal I sent last week.	40
はい、マーケットリサーチに関する件ですね。	"Yes, the one regarding the market research."	"Yes, it is about market research."	90
社内で内容を検討したのですが、ちょっと我々が求めていたものとは違っていた感じがあります。	I reviewed the contents internally and felt that it wasn't quite something we were looking for.	"I've considered the content within the company, but it feels a bit different from what we were looking for."	85
もう少し具体的にお話して頂けますか。	Can you be a bit more specific?	Can you tell me a little more specifically?	100
リサーチがもっと多くのトピックを掘り下げるのを期待していました。	We were hoping that the research will cover more topics in depths.	I was expecting a lot more of research to be grown up.	60
しかしおおむねすでに私たちが知っている情報をカバーしていました。	But it basically covers information we already know.	"However, we have covered the information we already know."	100
会社への聞き取り調査など、もっと実地調査を期待されていましたか？	Were you expecting more field work like interviewing companies?	Have you been expecting more research on the company?	50
はい、そうです。	That's correct.	Yes yes yes.	100
その場合、私共のサービスの料金体制が変わってきます。	"If that's the case, the cost structure for our service would be different."	"In that case, our service system will change."	60
それでは一律料金ではなくなるということですか？	So it won't be a flat price?	So it will not be the cost of the stock?	30
組み合わせになりますね。	It will be a combination.	It will be a doesn't it.	0
ですから基本料金の上に、実地調査を行う期間中に月々の依頼料がかかります。	So there will be the base price plus a monthly retainer fee for the duration of the field work.	So it will take a monthly request fee on the basic price.	10
また、旅費と毎日の食費もかかります。	"Also, travel expense and a daily meal allowance would have to be covered as well."	"Also, it will cost you a travel costs and a day food fee."	60
そうですか。	I see.	Yes is?	0
上司と話し合うので、その料金体制で別の提案を出して頂けますか？	How about you give me another proposal with that cost structure so I can discuss it with my boss.	"We're going to talk to our boss, so can you make another proposal on the price structure?"	60
はい、すぐにご用意できます。	Yeah I can whip that up quickly.	"Yes, you can be prepared immediately."	10
週末までに改訂した提案をお渡しします。	I think I can get you a revised proposal by the end of the week.	I will give you a suggestion that you have corrected by the end of the week	50
大変ありがたいです。	That would be great.	It is very grateful.	60
できるだけ早く送ってください。	Please send it to us as soon as you can.	Please send it as soon as possible.	100
そうします。	Will do.	Will do.	100
では、今日はお越しいただきありがとうございました。	"Well, thank you for coming today."	Thank you for coming today.	100

お元気でしたか？	How have you been?	How are you doing?	100
元気にしていました、ありがとうございます。	I've been good thank you.	"I was well, thank you."	50
最後にお話したのはいつでしたっけ？	When was the last time we talked?	When was the last time you talked?	10
２年ほど前に御社の保険を更新した時だったと思います。	I think it was around two years ago when we renewed your insurance.	I think it was when I updated your company’s insurance about two years ago.	100
ああ、そうでしたね。	Oh right.	"Oh, it was so."	60
今日お電話したのもその件なんです。	And I'm calling in regards to that.	"I called you today, that is the case."	20
えっ、もう更新の時期ですか？	Oh is it time for a renewal already?	"Oh, is it time for the update?"	90
そうなんですよ。	That's right.	Yes is it.	100
来年御社の販売量が拡大するかどうかお聞きしたかったんです。	I just wanted to ask if your sales volume will be increasing in the next year.	I wanted to ask you if your company will expand the sale level next year.	90
それが保険料を算出する要素になるんですよ。	That will factor into calculating the insurance rate.	It will be an element that calculates the insurance fee.	90
私たちの輸出事業のことですか？	You mean for our export business?	Is it about our export business?	100
はい、そうです。	Yes that's correct.	Yes yes yes.	100
そうですね、現在の販売高は400万ドル前後です。	"Well, we are doing around four million in sales right now."	"Yes, the current sales is about four million dollars."	100
来年は600万ドルに拡大すると見込んでいます。	We anticipate that will increase to six million next year.	We will expand to $ 9 million next year.	85
割引料金にしてもらえますかね？	Do you think we can get a discounted rate?	Can you give me a discount?	100
そう思いますよ。	I think so.	I think so.	100
御社はこれまで一度も保険請求をなさっていません。	You guys haven't had any insurance claims since you started.	You have never charged insurance before.	70
つまりローリスクとみなされるんですよ。	So you guys would be deemed low risk.	That is considered a low risk.	90
割引料金をご提供できると思います。	I think I can get you guys a lower rate.	I think you can provide a discount fee.	10
それは素晴らしい。	That would be great.	That is great.	100
料金に関しては来週またご連絡いたします。	I'll get back to you next week in regards to the rate.	We will contact you again next week for the fees.	100
分かりました。	Sounds good.	I understood.	100

それが、来週なんだよ。	It's happening next week.	That's next week.	100
今年既に君が作ってくれたプレゼンを見直していたんだが、書き換えが必要なところがあるんだ。	I was reviewing the presentation you made for me earlier this year and realized that it needs to be updated.	"I've already review the presentation you made this year, but I need you to change it."	70
それなら、もちろんできますよ。	Sure I can do that.	"Well, of course you can."	10
会社プレゼンの新しいバージョンが総務部から出ているか調べてくれるかい？	Can you check if there's a new version of the company presentation from the administration department?	Can you check if the new version of the company presentation will be from the general department?	40
はい、大抵ホームページの社内コンテンツに新しいのをアップしています。	"Yeah, they usually post new ones on the internal website."	"Yes, we usually increase the company’s content on our website."	40
