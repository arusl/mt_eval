今日は調査の進め方についてトレーニングします。	I will be teaching you how to conduct research today.	Today I'm going to train you on how to proceed with the investigation.
オンライン調査みたいなものですか？	Like just searching online?	It's like an online investigation?
それも含みます。	Yes and no.	I'll include that too.
まず、出所が正規のところであるかどうか確認しないといけません。	First of all we need to make sure the sources are legitimate.	First of all, I have to make sure that my source is normal.
ブログとかコラムなどはだめということですか？	So no blogs or editorial?	Does that mean you can't do blogs or columns?
そのとおり。	Exactly.	That's right.
最初に見るところは政府のホームページです。	The first place I would look at is government websites.	The first thing you'll see is the government's home page.
政府の数字は、一般的に正確で信用性が高いものです。	They typically have accurate data that is trustworthy.	Government figures are generally accurate and reliable.
他に良いサイトは？	What other websites would be good?	Any better sites?
大手の銀行、会計事務所、市場調査会社などの企業データも活用できます。	You can also check out major institutions like banks, accounting companies, and market research companies.	You can also use corporate data, such as large banks, accounting offices, market research companies.
どうしてですか？	Why those?	Why?
こうした企業は有名で、たいてい質の良い市況報告を発行しています。	They are well known and typically publishes good market reports.	These companies are famous and publish good-quality market reports.
でも、市況報告は無料でないこともあります。	But some market reports aren't free.	But sometimes city reports are not free.
なので、無料データで探します。	So stick to the ones that are free.	So I'll look for it on free data.
でも、もし、有料データで良さそうなのがあったら？	What if it seems the report is useful?	(Laughter)
私に相談してください。	You can consult with me then.	Talk to me.
でも、君がやるのはほとんど予備調査だよ。	But a lot of the research you will be doing is preliminary research.	But what you do most of the time is preliminary research.
経営陣に見せるような調査ではありません。	So it won't be presented to upper management.	This isn't the kind of investigation that we're going to show the management.
わかりました。	I see.	Okay.
市況報告書を購入するようなケースはあるのですか？	Would there be cases when we would purchase market reports?	Are there cases where you might buy a municipal report?
詳しい実現可能性調査をするようなときには購入が必要になります。	We will need them when we conduct detailed feasibility studies.	You'll need to buy it when you're looking into the possibility of further fulfillment.
そういう調査は上層部へ報告されるので、専門の第３者企業に認証された情報でなければなりません。	These will be presented to the upper management so we need to show that the information is validated by professional third-party companies.	Such investigations will be reported to the highest levels, so they must be approved by the third company of experts.
わかりました。	Got it.	Okay.
ベンさん、こんにちは、またお会いできて嬉しいです。	Hi Ben, it's nice to see you again.	It's nice to see you again, Ben.
こちらこそお会いできて嬉しいです。	Nice to see you as well.	I'm glad to see you too.
ビジネスの方はいかがですか。	Business has been good?	How's the business going?
休暇のシーズンでちょっと活気がないですが、それが普通です。	It's been a bit slow with the holiday season but that's normal.	I don't feel a little active during the vacation season, but that's normal.
今日はお越しいただいてありがとうございます。	Again thank you for coming in today.	Thank you for coming today.
先週送って頂いた提案についてお話したかったんです。	I wanted to discuss the proposal you sent me last week.	I wanted to tell you about the proposal you sent me last week.
はい、マーケットリサーチに関する件ですね。	Yes, the one regarding the market research.	Yes, it's about market research, isn't it?
社内で内容を検討したのですが、ちょっと我々が求めていたものとは違っていた感じがあります。	I reviewed the contents internally and felt that it wasn't quite something we were looking for.	I've considered the content inside the company, but I feel like it was a little different from what we were looking for.
もう少し具体的にお話して頂けますか。	Can you be a bit more specific?	Can you be a little more specific?
リサーチがもっと多くのトピックを掘り下げるのを期待していました。	We were hoping that the research will cover more topics in depths.	I was hoping research would dig down more topics.
しかしおおむねすでに私たちが知っている情報をカバーしていました。	But it basically covers information we already know.	But the information we already knew had been covered.
会社への聞き取り調査など、もっと実地調査を期待されていましたか？	Were you expecting more field work like interviewing companies?	Were you expected to do more field research, such as interviewing the company?
はい、そうです。	That's correct.	Yes, that's right.
その場合、私共のサービスの料金体制が変わってきます。	If that's the case, the cost structure for our service would be different.	In that case, our cost system will change.
それでは一律料金ではなくなるということですか？	So it won't be a flat price?	Does that mean it won't be a fair price?
組み合わせになりますね。	It will be a combination.	It's a combination, isn't it?
ですから基本料金の上に、実地調査を行う期間中に月々の依頼料がかかります。	So there will be the base price plus a monthly retainer fee for the duration of the field work.	So there's a monthly fee on top of the basic fare during field research.
また、旅費と毎日の食費もかかります。	Also, travel expense and a daily meal allowance would have to be covered as well.	It also costs travel and meals every day.
そうですか。	I see.	Is that so?
上司と話し合うので、その料金体制で別の提案を出して頂けますか？	How about you give me another proposal with that cost structure so I can discuss it with my boss.	I'm going to talk to my boss, so could you come up with another offer on the charge system?
はい、すぐにご用意できます。	Yeah I can whip that up quickly.	Yes, we can get you ready right away.
週末までに改訂した提案をお渡しします。	I think I can get you a revised proposal by the end of the week.	By the end of the week, I'll give you a proposal that I've revised.
大変ありがたいです。	That would be great.	Thank you very much.
できるだけ早く送ってください。	Please send it to us as soon as you can.	Please send it as soon as possible.
そうします。	Will do.	I will.

ああ、そうでしたね。	Oh right.	Oh, that's right.
今日お電話したのもその件なんです。	And I'm calling in regards to that.	That's why I called you today.
えっ、もう更新の時期ですか？	Oh is it time for a renewal already?	Oh, it's time for the update, isn't it?
そうなんですよ。	That's right.	That's right.
来年御社の販売量が拡大するかどうかお聞きしたかったんです。	I just wanted to ask if your sales volume will be increasing in the next year.	I wanted to ask if your sales will increase next year.
それが保険料を算出する要素になるんですよ。	That will factor into calculating the insurance rate.	That's the factor that's going to raise the premium.
私たちの輸出事業のことですか？	You mean for our export business?	Are you referring to our export business?
はい、そうです。	Yes that's correct.	Yes, that's right.
そうですね、現在の販売高は400万ドル前後です。	Well, we are doing around four million in sales right now.	Well, today's sales range is around $4 million.
来年は600万ドルに拡大すると見込んでいます。	We anticipate that will increase to six million next year.	We expect it to grow to $6 million next year.
割引料金にしてもらえますかね？	Do you think we can get a discounted rate?	Could you charge me a discount?
そう思いますよ。	I think so.	I think so.
御社はこれまで一度も保険請求をなさっていません。	You guys haven't had any insurance claims since you started.	Your company has never made an insurance claim.
つまりローリスクとみなされるんですよ。	So you guys would be deemed low risk.	I mean, it's considered a low risk.
割引料金をご提供できると思います。	I think I can get you guys a lower rate.	I think I can offer you a discount charge.
それは素晴らしい。	That would be great.	That's great.

あるイベントでプレゼンをやるんだが、うちの会社の紹介をしなくてはいけないんだ。	I'm actually doing a presentation at an event and will need to introduce our company.	I give a presentation at an event, but I have to introduce my company.
それが、来週なんだよ。	It's happening next week.	That's next week.
今年既に君が作ってくれたプレゼンを見直していたんだが、書き換えが必要なところがあるんだ。	I was reviewing the presentation you made for me earlier this year and realized that it needs to be updated.	I've already been reviewing your presentation this year, but there's something I need to rewrite.
それなら、もちろんできますよ。	Sure I can do that.	Then of course you can do it.
会社プレゼンの新しいバージョンが総務部から出ているか調べてくれるかい？	Can you check if there's a new version of the company presentation from the administration department?	Can you check to see if the new version of the company presentation comes from the General Department?

ミレニアルが多すぎだと思うよ。	Too many millennials if you ask me.	I think there's too many mirenianis.
一緒に働いてみてどんな感じかい？	How has it been having them work for you?	What's it like to work together?
順応しないといけないのは確かだね。	It's definitely an adjustment.	I'm sure you have to adjust.
我らの世代とは全く違うのは知ってるだろう？	You know they are very different from our generation.	You know, it's completely different from our generation.
私にとっても学ぶ機会になってるよ。	It has been a learning experience for me as well.	It's an opportunity for me to learn.
明らかにミレニアルは違う勤労倫理を持っているよね。	Obviously, the millennials have different work ethic.	Obviously, the Guineans have a different work ethic.
私は批判的かもしれないけど。	I might sound a little judgmental here.	I may be critical.
彼らは少々甘やかされていて、怠けている感じがするね。	But they come off a little bit entitled and lazy.	They're a little spoiled, and it feels like they're lazy.
言いたいことわかるよ。	I see what you are saying.	I know what you mean.
我らの世代は、出世のために仕事に時間も労力も費やしてきただろう。	Our generation is willing to invest our time and effort in order to build our careers.	Our generation has spent time and effort working to get ahead.
一般的に我々は自分自身の仕事、会社の為に献身的なんだ。	We were generally committed to our jobs and the companies we work for.	In general, we're devoted to our own work and the company.
そうだよ、私は25年間ずっとそうやってきた。	Yep, that's what I have been doing for the last 25 years.	That's right. I've been doing that for 25 years.
でもミレニアルは我々ほど献身的ではなさそうだね。	But the millennials don't seem as committed as we are.	But it doesn't seem to be as devoted as we are.
数年経つと、新しい機会を見つけて去っていく傾向にあるんだ。	They tend to leave for new opportunities after a few years.	I tend to find new opportunities and leave after a few years.
何を優先させるかというのも違うよね？	Their priorities are different too, right?	It doesn't matter what your priorities are, does it?
彼らは長い目で見て、自分に有利になる様な事を求めているようだ。	It seems that they wanted something that benefit them in the long run.	They seem to be looking for something to their advantage in the long run.
ミレニアルは不景気や職の不安定さを経験しているから、どんな事でも同じ状況が続くとは期待していないんだよ。	With the bad economy and the job insecurities the millennials have experienced, they don't expect things to stay the same.	Because of the recession and the instability of the job, I don't expect anything to continue the same.
彼らが頻繁に職を変えるのはそれが理由かい？	Is that the reason they tend to switch jobs more frequently?	Is that why they often change jobs?
多分ね、でも私の勘違いかもしれないけど。	Maybe, but I could be mistaken.	Maybe, but maybe I'm wrong.
今年うちに雇われた従業員は真面目そうだけどね。	The ones we hired this year seem pretty decent though.	The employees who were hired by this year seem serious.
そうだね。	I agree with you.	That's right.
彼らが違う世代なんだという事を受け入れないといけないんだよ。	I need to accept the fact that they are totally different generation.	We have to accept that they are a different generation.
そして少し大目に見てあげないと。	And I need to cut them some slack.	And I have to be a little tolerant.
マリッサとケイラブの働きぶりを見たけど、彼らはとても真面目だよ。	I have supervised Marissa and Caleb, and they work really hard.	I saw how Marissa and Kayab work, but they're very serious.
ただ数年後には彼らも我々の元を去ってしまうのか心配だけど。	I am just afraid they will leave us in a few years.	It's just that I'm afraid they'll leave us in a few years.
それは私も心配だね。	That's my fear too.	I'm worried about that too.
彼らは失うには勿体ない人材だよ。	They are too good to let go.	They deserve to be lost.
それは、もう一つ考えなければいけない事だね。	That's another thing to consider.	That's one more thing to think about.
どうにかして従業員の離職率を低めて、定着率を上げる方法を見つけないといけないな。	We have to figure out ways to reduce turnover and increase employee retention.	I'm gonna have to find a way to lower the unemployment rate of my employees and increase the steady rate.
私にいけてる上司になれという意味かい？	Does that mean I have to be the coolest boss to make them like me?	You want me to be the boss I'm supposed to be?
ならなくてもいいけど、なるとプラスにはなるね。	You don't have to, but it probably will help.	It doesn't have to be, but it'll be positive when it comes to it.
でも君は君のままでいいよ。	But you just have to be you.	But you can stay you.
もうすでに君は若い従業員にとって素晴らしい見本だよ。	You are a great role model for them already.	You're already a wonderful example for young employees.
有難う。	Thank you for saying that.	Thank you.
じゃあ今からまた最高の上司になって若い子たちの手助けをしてくるよ。	Now let me get back to being an awesome boss and help those young people.	Then I'm going to be the best boss ever to help the young.
話せて良かったよ。	It was nice chatting with you.	It was nice talking to you.
コピー用紙がもうすぐなくなりそうだけど。	We're almost running out of copy paper.	The copy paper is going to run out soon.
そうですか、気づいていませんでした。	Oh, I didn't notice.	Well, I didn't notice.
今すぐ注文しておきますね。	I'll order now.	I'll order it now, won't I?
今週中に届くかな。	Do you think they'll come this week?	I wonder if it'll arrive by the end of the week.
週末までにたくさん印刷するものがあるんだよ。	I need to print out lots of things by weekend.	There are lots of things to print by the end of the week.
いつも注文した翌日に届くので、大丈夫でしょう。	They usually deliver the next day, so it should be fine.	It'll arrive the day after I've ordered it, so I'm sure it'll be okay.
でも、念のために、注文の際に確認しておきますね。	But I'll double check when I order, just in case.	But in case you don't mind, I'll make sure when I order.
よろしく頼む。	Appreciate it.	Nice to meet you.
ついでに、大きめの封筒も少し頼んでくれるかな。	Can you also order large envelopes together?	By the way, I'd like a few big envelopes too.
分かりました。	Sure.	Okay.
他には何かいりますか？	Anything else?	Can I get you anything else?
いや、それだけだ。	No, that's it.	No, that's all.
じゃ、頼んでおきますね。	Ok, it will be done soon.	Then I'll ask you to do it.
ありがとう。	Thanks.	Thank you.
すみません、森さん、ちょっといいですか？	Excuse me, Mori-san, can I ask you something?	Excuse me, Mr. Mori, may I have a word?
はい、何でしょう。	Yes, how can I help?	Yes, what is it?
客先に出すこのメール文、これでいいでしょうか？	Could you check my e-mail letter to the client?	Would you like this e-mail to be sent to your client?
えーと、ここ、語順をこういうふうに入れ替えた方がいいと思いますけど。	Hmm, here, I think you should change the word order, like this.	Well, I think it would be better if we changed the order of words here.
えっ、今のすごい早いですね。	Wow, it’s so quick.	Oh, you're so fast right now.
コピペショートカットキーを使ったのよ。	I used copy-and-paste short cut keys.	I used the Cappe shortcut key.
コントロールキーとCでコピーして、コントロールとVでペーストするんです。	You can press control key and C to copy, and then paste it with control and V keys.	I copy it with control keys and C and paste it with control and V.
へー、ショートカットキーは便利ですね。	Ah, short cuts are useful, aren’t they?	Hey, shortcut keys are useful.
森さんは、パソコンでメール打つのも早いですよね。	You type e-mails so fast on the PC, don’t you?	Don't you think it's too soon for Mr. Mori to e-mail on his computer?
僕は携帯メールは早く打てるんですけどね。	I can send text messages on my mobile very fast.	I'm using my cell phone early.
中村さんたちはスマホ世代だから、フリック入力は早いのよね。	You are in the smartphone generation, so you use flick input skilfully.	Mr. Nakamura is a mobile generation, so Flick input is fast, isn't it?
私は、携帯だと画面の文字が小さくてメガネなしには良く見えないし。	I can’t see small letters on my mobile screen without reading glasses.	I can't see well without glasses on my cell phone because it's too small for my screen.
スマホなら画面拡大できますよ。	But you can zoom in on the letters on a smartphone.	If you have a phone, you can zoom in on the screen.
うーん、それでも、なんか使いにくい。	I know, even so, I can’t see the whole picture.	Well, it's still hard to use.
キーは２つ一緒に打っちゃうし、パソコンの方が楽だわ。	And my finger catches two keys at the same time, so I prefer to type on PC.	Two keys are hit together, and a computer is easier.
僕のうちにはもう、ラップトップはないですよ。	We no longer use laptops in my family.	I don't have any laptops anymore.
ふーん。	Hmm.	Hmm.
みなさん、おはようございます。	Good morning, everyone.	Good morning everyone.
会議を始めますよ。	Could I have your attention, please?	We're going to start a meeting.
ご出席ありがとうございます。	Thank you all for coming.	Thank you for coming.
さあ本題に入りましょう。	Let's get down to business.	Let's get to the point.
このミーティングは社内での紙の消費量を減らすことについて話し合うのが目的です。	The goal of this meeting is to talk about reducing paper consumption in our office.	This meeting is designed to talk about reducing paper consumption in the company.
アレックス、この件について意見はありますか？	Alex, what's your opinion on this?	Alex, do you have any opinions on this?
素晴らしいアイディアだと思います。	I think it's a great idea.	I think it's a great idea.
我が社は昨年コピー用紙の購入に10,000ドル以上費やしました。	We spent more than 10,000 dollars on purchasing printer paper last year.	Our company spent more than 10,000 dollars buying copy paper last year.
インクカートリッジやペーパークリップ、フォルダーを含まずにこの金額です。	That doesn't even include printer ink, paper clips, and folders.	This is the amount of money without ink cartridges, paper clips, or folders.
ペーパーレス化を進めることで多額のお金を節約できるでしょう。	We would save huge sums of money by going paperless.	You can save a lot of money by moving on paperlessing.
それに書類の保管に場所を取られすぎていますし。	We also dedicate too much storage space to paperwork.	And you've taken too much space to keep the papers.
そうですね、私もそう思っていました。	Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.	That's right. I thought so, too.
フランシスコ、他にこの件について意見はありますか？	Francisco, do you have any other thoughts on this?	Francisco, do you have any other opinions on this?
まだ言及されていない利点があるとすれば環境にも優しい点です。	One advantage we haven't talked about is the environmental benefits.	If there are benefits you haven't mentioned yet, it's also kind to the environment.
私たちが書類をデジタル式で保存するようになればゴミも少なくなるでしょう。	We'll produce less waste if we start saving our paperwork digitally.	If we begin to store the documents digitally, there will be fewer trash.
それも私が取り組みたいと思っていたことです。	That's also something I wanted to work on.	That's also what I wanted to work on.
アダム、あなたはどう思いますか？	What do you think, Adam?	Adam, what do you think?
紙の使用を直ちに完全に止めるのは多分難しいでしょう。	It will probably be hard to go completely paper free at once.	It will probably be difficult to stop the use of paper completely immediately.
少しずつ進めるしかないでしょうね。	I think we'll probably have to take baby steps.	We're going to have to move on a little bit, aren't we?
部によって書類作成へのニーズがまちまちなので、それぞれの部が部内の紙の使用量を管理すべきでしょう。	Each division should manage their paper usage since they all have different needs for documentation.	Since different parts of the document need different requirements, each section should manage its own paper usage.
新たに発生する書類をみんながデジタル式で保存することが第一歩かもしれません。	We could probably start by having everyone save new paperwork digitally.	It may be a first step to save new documents in digital form for everyone.
その後、だれかが過去の書類もデジタル式コピーに変換すればいいのです。	Then, someone could convert the old paperwork into digital copies.	After that, someone has to convert past documents into digital copies.
最初のうちは苦労すると思いますが、ファイルの中で書類が行方不明になるのも防げるかもしれませんし。	I think it would take a lot of work in the beginning, but it might help prevent papers getting misplaced in files.	I think it'll be hard at first, but I think it might be possible to prevent the documents from missing in the file.
なるほど。	That seems like a good idea.	I see.
どんな選択肢があるか技術チームに掛け合ってみましょう。	I'll meet with the tech team to see what our options are.	Let's call the tech team and see what options they have.
いろいろなソフトウェアを比べてどれが最適か評価しないといけないですからね。	We'll need to evaluate different softwares to see which will work best.	We have to evaluate which is best compared to different software.
それから実装やトレーニングにかかるコストを算出できますね。	Then we can calculate how much the implementation and training will cost.	Then we can figure out the cost of implementation and training.
次のミーティングでは詳細をさらに議論できると思います。	I think we can discuss these details further next meeting.	I think we can discuss further details at the next meeting.
話を進めて技術チームから複数のソフトウェア案を見せてくれる方にお越しいただきましょう。	I'll go ahead and bring in someone from the tech team to show you the different software options.	I'd like to invite you to come forward and show us a number of software plans from the technical team.
みなさん、お疲れ様でした！	Great meeting, team!	Thank you all for your hard work!
由衣さん、久しぶり！	Yui, it's been a long time!	It's been a long time!
あ、キースさん、本当久しぶり！	Hi, Keith, yeah, it's been ages!	Oh, Mr. Keith, it's been a long time!
そうそう、例の大型プロジェクト、由衣さんの案が採用だって？	Oh, by the way I heard your proposal got approved for that large-scale project.	Oh, yeah. Is that your big project?
わあ、もう聞いてます？	Wow, you've heard about that all ready?	Wow, have you heard that yet?
うん、この間ブラウン課長が話してたよ。	Yes, Mr. Brown was talking about that the other day.	Yeah, Chief Brown talked about it the other day.
おめでとう。	Congratulations!	Congratulations.
ありがとう。	Why thank you.	Thank you.
あの鬼のブラウン課長に認めて貰えるのはすごいと思うよ。	It's amazing that you got recognized from Mr. Brown, the section chief with a heart of stone.	I think it's great to be accepted by that demon Chief Brown.
しー、それ聞こえたら大変。	Shhh, what if he catches you calling him that.	Shh. It's hard to hear that.
キースさんって、前ブラウン課長のプロジェクトチームに居たんだっけ。	Oh right, Keith, you were in his project team before.	Mr Keith was on Chief Brown's project team, wasn't he?
うん、なんか怖そうに見えるかもしれないけど、出来る人だよ。	Yup, he might look somewhat intimidating, but he's an able person.	Yeah, it may look scary, but he's a man who can do it.
それもあって、ちょっとプレッシャー感じてるんだ。	That's one of the reasons I feel a bit nervous.	That's what I'm feeling a little under pressure.
ああ、かなり大きい案件だしね。	Well, I guess, it's a pretty big project, too.	Oh, it's a pretty big case.
来週までに人員計画出して、人事にも確認取らなきゃで、あー、もう既に忙しくて。	I have to draft a staffing plan by next week, get approval from HR, aghh, I already have a lot to do.	I have to start a personnel program by next week and check on personnel. Ah, I'm already busy.
由衣さん、落ち着いて。	Relax, Yui.	You need to calm down, Mr. Yuri.
あのね、それ事前に人事の安田さんに話し通しとくと全然楽だから。	Look, it'll get much easier if you run it by Ms. Yasuda in HR beforehand.	You know, it's really easy to talk it over with Mr. Takada of personnel before you do that.
あと、ブラウン課長のとこは残業気をつけてね。	But you should be careful if you do overtime when you work under Mr. Brown.	And be careful with Chief Brown.
ありがと、頑張ってみる。	Thanks, I'll try my best.	Thank you. I'll try my best.
ああ、ここでのんびりコーヒー飲んでる場合じゃないかも。	Well, I guess I shouldn't even be here having coffee.	Ah, it's probably not time to have a slow cup of coffee here.
こら、おしゃべりな同僚と気分切り替えるのも必要でしょ？	Hey, you should also refresh yourself with a chatty coworker, right?	Hey, you need to switch moods with a chatty colleague, right?
そうだ、ひと休みするって事で、金曜日はかなり忙しい？	Oh yeah, speaking of taking a break, are you super busy on Friday?	Yeah, you're pretty busy with Friday because you're taking a break?
えっと、１９日だよね？	let's see, you mean the 19th?	Well, it's the 19th, isn't it?
んーどうかな、明日どれくらい進むかによるけど。	Well, I really can't tell, depends on how far along I get tomorrow.	I don't know, depending on how far we're going tomorrow.
なんで？	What about it?	Why?
早めに上がれそうなら、お祝いに俺が奢るっての、どう？	If you can get off early, how about I buy you a drink and toast to your success.	If you can get up early, why don't I buy you a present?
やった、ゴチになります！	Yay, I like that idea!	Oh, my God!
あの角のバルとか、安いとこでよければだけど。	If you don't mind going to a cheapie place like that Spanish bar at the corner, though.	If you don't mind the bar on that corner, or the cheap cousin on that corner.
全然いい、気合い入れて定時に終わらせる。	Doesn't matter at all, I'll push myself to get the work done on time.	It's totally fine. It's done on time.
仕事終わりにラインすればいい？	Should I LINE you when I'm done?	Can I line up at the end of work?
俺、ラインあんまり見ないから、携帯メールの方がいいかな。	I don't check my LINE very often so I think a text message to my mobile is better.	I don't see much line, so I think I'd better use my cell phone.
あの既読とか付いて返信しなきゃいけない気がするの、苦手なんだよね。	I don't really like that massages get marked as read, and these makes you feel like you have to reply right away.	I feel like I have to read that book and reply back, so I'm not good at it.
あ、ブラウン課長はいつもラインで、スタンプも送ってくるよ。	Oh, Mr. Brown always uses LINE and he sends messages with stickers, too.	Oh, Chief Brown is always on line, and he's sending you a stamp.
まじで！？	No way!!	Really?
まじまじ、結構お茶目なとこあるよ。	Seriously, he does silly things sometimes.	Really, there's a lot of tea in there.
そうだ、ブラウン課長も誘ってみない？	Yeah, why don't we ask Mr. Brown to join us?	Yeah, why don't you ask Chief Brown?
うわー、それはちょっとまだハードル高いかも。	Oh no, that is too much of a challenge for me right now.	Wow, that might still be a little expensive.
打ち解ければ結構いい人だし、今後仕事もしやすいと思うけど。	He's quite a nice guy once you get to know him and I think it'll help you when you work together.	She's a good person if she's open, and I think it's easier for her to work in the future.
うーん、ちょっと考えさせて。	Well, let me think about that.	Well, let me think.
とにかく無理そうなら早めに連絡ちょうだい。	Anyway, if you can't make it, can you text me ASAP?	If you can't make it anyway, please let me know early.
了解。	You got it.	Yes, sir.

つまり、従業員の社内異動を奨励していますが、みんな最低6ヶ月間はひとつのチームに留まってもらうようにしています。	This means that we are more than happy to have people switch teams, but we try to keep everyone on one team for at least 6 months	I mean, I encourage employees to move inside the company, but everyone stays on one team for at least six months.
異動による混乱が起こらず、従業員が良い仕事をし続ける限り、なんの問題もないと思っています。	As long as the change isn't disruptive and the employee continues to produce quality work, we certainly don't have a problem with it.

機密保持に関しては大丈夫でしょうか。	How is it in terms of the confidentiality?	Is everything okay with classified custody?
当社との協同契約内の範囲であれば、社内への発信は大丈夫だということです。	As long as it is included in our collaboration contract, we can share it within the company.	If it's within our partnership agreement, it's safe to send a message to the company.
ならば、安心です。	Glad to hear.	Then I'll be safe.
そこがちょっと気にかかってましたので。	I was worried about that a little bit.	I was a little concerned there.
ページ数としては、10ページまでのほうが、忙しい社員の皆さんにも読んでもらえると思っています。	As for the volume, I think 10 pages are the max since everyone is too busy to read a lot.	For the number of pages, I think 10 pages will be read by the busy workers.
そうですね、あんまり量が多いと読む気をなくされてしまいますから。	I agree, people would lose interest if there is too much info.	That's right, when you have too much, you don't want to read too much.
それから、英語版も作るという話を聞いていたのですが、それは？	I've heard about making the English version, but is it happening too?	(Laughter)
現時点では、日本語版のみで、ということになりました。	At this point, we will only do Japanese.	At this point, it's decided to be in Japanese only.
英語版も作るとなると、翻訳者の手配も含め時間がかかりますからね。	If we try to make the English version, it will take more time including the time to find translators.	When it comes to making English translations, it takes time, including the arrangements for translators.
まずは定期的に刊行することを目標としたいので。	I would like to make our current goal is to publish them regularly.	First of all, I want to make it our goal to publish regularly.
確かに、最初から意気込み過ぎて長続きしなくなるのはよくありませんよね。	I see, it is not good if we run out of gas by trying to do too much at the beginning.	I'm sure it's not good to go too hard in the first place and not go on for too long, is it?
そうなんですよ。	Right.	That's right.
まずは、日本語を話す社員向けにニュースレターを定着させるのが優先です。	Our priority now is to establish the existence of internal newsletters for Japanese-speaking employees.	First of all, it is important to set up a news letter for Japanese-speaking employees.
研究開発部以外の皆さんが技術に興味を持ってくれるようなきっかけにしたいですね。	I wish this could be the reason for non-R-and-D people to get more interested in technologies.	I'd like to give you an opportunity to take an interest in technology other than the R&amp;D.
それによって新しい商品のアイデアも出てくると思うんですよね。	I think people would come up with more ideas about new products because of it.	I think that's going to bring up the idea of a new product, too.
営業の人たちも、技術的なトークが出来ることはプラスになると思いますし。	It'll also be an advantage for the sales people if they can talk about technologies.	I think it's good for business people to have technical talks too.
日本語版が定着し海外支社のほうから要望があれば、英語版はその時に考えましょう。	Once the Japanese version is established and if our overseas office makes a request, we will think about the English version then.	If the Japanese version has settled down and the foreign office asks for it, let's think about English at that time.
そうしましょう。	Good idea.	Let's do that.
ニュースレターの担当には、うちのグループの若い子を数名考えています。	I am thinking about appointing some of younger employees in our group to work on newsletters.	I'm thinking of a few young girls from our group in my news letter.
実際のインタビューやライティングは彼らに任せます。	I will have them do the actual interviews and writing.	I leave actual interviews and lighting to them.
じゃ、田中さんは監修者ということですね。	Then you will be the supervisor.	So you're an intern, aren't you?
そうですね。	Exactly.	That's right.
では、また担当者が決まったら名前を教えてください。	Please let me know when you pick the people.	Then please let me know your name again when the person in charge decides to do so.
はい、このプロジェクトうまく成功させましょう。	Yes, let's make this project a success.	Yes, let's make this project a success.
はい、お願いします。	Definitely.	Yes, please.
もしもし、E社です。	Hello, this is E Company.	Hello, it's company E.
もしもし、こちらG社研究開発部の森田と申します。	Hello, this is Morita from the R and D at Company G.	Hello, this is Morita from the G research and development department.
あ、森田さん、お世話になっております。	Oh hi, Mr. Morita, good to hear from you.	Oh, Mr. Morita, I'm looking after you.
商品開発の山田が電話を待っていたようですので、少々お待ちください。	It looks like Yamada from the product development has been waiting for your call, so please hold.	The product development Yamada seems to have been waiting for a call, so please wait a moment.
はい。	Sure.	Yes.
もしもし、森田さん、山田です。	Hi Mr. Morita, this is Yamada.	Hello, Morita san, this is Yamada.
お世話になってます。	How are you?	Thank you for your help.
例の商品プロトタイプの件でお電話しました。	I am calling you regarding those product prototypes.	I called about that product prototype type.
あ、待ってましたよ、ありがとうございます。	Oh, I was waiting, thank you.	Oh, I've been waiting for you. Thank you.
それで、どんな調子ですか？	And how do they look?	So, how's it going?
試しに２、３個作ってみましたが、いい感じです。	We made a couple just to test out, and they look good.	I tried making a few, but it looks good.
そうですか、それは良かった。	Oh, that's good.	Well, that's good.
それで、お見せしたいと思っているのですが、こちらまでお越しいただけますでしょうか。	So I would like to show you those, and I wonder if you could come over here.	So, I'd like to show you, but would you please come this far?
あ、いいですよ。	Of course, I can.	Oh, it's okay.
こっちに持って来ていただくのは大変だと思うので。	I think it will be hard for you to bring them here.	I think it's difficult for you to bring it here.
そうなんですよ、結構重たいので。	Yes, they are pretty heavy.	That's right, because it's heavy.
そうですよね、スペック的に無理言ってますから。	I know, we are being unreasonable in terms of specifications.	That's right, because I'm not going to make it.
いえいえ、それはいいんですが。	No no, that's not a problem.	No, no, that's fine.
プロトタイプなので、移動中に壊れる可能性がありまして。	It's just that they are only prototypes that they might break while being transported.	It's a prototype, so it could break during the move.
あ、正式な商品じゃないから、そこまでパッケージングに力は入れてないですよね。	Oh right, since they are not officially products yet, you have not focused on the packaging much.	Ah, it's not an official product, so we haven't put much effort into packing that much, have we?
ええ、パッケージングはまた別枠になりますから。	Exactly, packaging will be another matter.	Yeah, packing will be another frame again.
じゃ、来週あたりお伺いしましょうか。	Then I will visit you next week or so.	Shall we call on you next week?
火曜日以外ならいつでもいいですよ。	We are good anytime except for Tuesday.	Any time except Tuesday.
私のほうが月曜に予定があるので、じゃ、水曜ということで。	I have somethng on Monday, so how about Wednesday?	I have more plans for Monday, so it's only Wednesday then.
いいですよ。	It works.	It's okay.
お昼前に来ていただければ、一緒にランチミーティングも出来ますが。	If you can come over before lunch, we can have a lunch meeting together.	If you could come before noon, we could have a lunch meeting.
そうですね、久しぶりに他のエンジニアの方ともお話したいので、そうします。	Sounds good, since I would like to talk to other engineers, I'll do that.	Well, I'd like to talk to another engineer for a long time, so I'll do so.
じゃ、10時半頃にということでいいですか？	So is around ten thirty good?	So it's about 10:30?
ええ、お願いします。	Yes, sure.	Yes, please.
あ、一つ忘れていましたが、今回お願いしたのとは別の商品のプロトタイプが必要となりそうなんです。	Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing, but we might need prototypes for another product that is not the same as this one.	Ah, I forgot one thing, but I think I'm going to need another product prototype instead of the one I asked you to do.
ほお。	Okay?	Oh.
来週、仕様書をお持ちしていいですか？	Can I bring the spec for it next week?	May I bring the specs next week?
可能かどうか見ていただけると助かるんですが。	It would be helpful if you could tell me it's feasible or not.	I'd appreciate it if you could see if it's possible.
分かりました、お持ちください。	I see, please bring it with you then.	I understand. Please bring it.
では、そうさせていただきます。	Will do.	Then I'll let you do so.
毎回無理言ってすいません。	I apologize for being unreasonable all the time.	I'm sorry to bother you every time.
いいですよ、実はエンジニアたちはプロトタイプ作りを楽しみにしてるんですよね。	Not a problem, actually engineers enjoy making prototypes.	It's okay, actually, engineers are looking forward to prototype making, aren't they?
商品の形が見えるのって面白いですからね。	It is fun to see what the actual product looks like.	It's interesting to see the shape of the product.
そうですか、では来週楽しみにしています。	Good to hear, then I will see you next week.	Well, I'm looking forward to it next week.
こちらこそ。	See you then.	It's nice to meet you too.
もしもし、請求書について伺いたいのですが？	Hello, I'd like to inquire about an invoice.	Hello, I'd like to ask you about the bill.
担当の者におつなぎいたしますので少々お待ち下さい。	I will transfer you to the person in charge so please hold a moment.	Please wait a moment, I'll connect you to the person in charge.
はい、担当の平井と申します。	Hello, my name is Hirai and I am in charge.	Yes, I'm Ms. Shii. I'm in charge.
先日送られてきた請求書のことでお伺いしたいのですが、よろしいですか？	I'd like to ask you something in regards to an invoice that was sent a few days ago, are you okay to talk now?	May I ask about the bill sent to you the other day?
はい、請求書番号はお手元にございますか？	Yes, do you have the invoice number in hand?	Yes, sir. Do you have the bill number?
はい、１５７７８４です。	Yes, it is 157784.	Yes, 157784.
少々お待ち下さい、はい、どうぞ。	Please wait a bit, ok go on.	Please wait a moment. Yes, please.
この二行目にあるタンクの注文ですが、型番が間違って送られてきたので、注文自体をキャンセルしたのですが。	It's in regards to the order on the tank in the second row, and a wrong model was sent to us and I'd like to cancel the order itself.	I've ordered the tank in this second line, but since the mold was sent wrong, I've canceled the order itself.
確認いたしますので少々お待ち下さい。	I will look into it so please hold a moment.	I'll be sure. Please wait a moment.
申し訳ありません、注文された型番の方を後日速達でお送りさせて頂いたようなのですが、そちらに届いておりませんか？	I'm very sorry about that, we actually send off an expedited shipment of the model you ordered but have you received it?	I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to send the orders for the model at a later speed. Would you like to come over?
いや、届いたんだけど、結局必要な期日までに間に合わなかったので、オンラインでキャンセルさせて頂きました。	Yes, it arrived but we didn't end up getting it by the date we needed it so I cancelled it online.	No, I got it, but I didn't make it by the time I needed it, so I had to cancel it online.
申し訳ありませんでした。	I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.	I'm sorry.
ではお手数ですがそちらの商品を再度こちらに返品いただけますでしょうか？	I'm very sorry but will it be possible to return the product back to us again?	Would you mind returning your product to us again?
これで二個目ですよ、こちらも忙しいのでそちらから取りに来ていただけませんか？	This is the second time, we're busy too so can you send someone over to pick it up?	This is the second one. I'm busy too. Could you come and pick it up for me?
かしこまりました、こちらで郵送会社の手配をいたしますので恐れ入りますが返品の準備だけよろしくお願いします。	Okay, I will make an arrangement with the postal office so it would be appreciated if you can prepare the return.	Yes, sir. I'll arrange for a shipping company here, so I'll be very afraid, but please keep ready for the return.
わかりました。	Okay.	Okay.
それから、新しい請求書はメールで送信していただけますか？	Also, can you send me the new invoice by email?	Then send me a new bill by email?
かしこまりました。	Of course.	Yes, sir.
それではメールアドレスの確認を再度お願いいたします。	Please allow me to reconfirm your email.	Please check your email address again.
あと、クレジットカードで支払いできますか。	Also, can I pay by credit card?	Can I pay by credit card?
はい、大丈夫です。	Yes, that won't be an issue.	Yes, I'm fine.
では返品の確認が出来次第、こちらより再度お支払いに関してのお電話を差し上げますので、よろしくお願いします。	So once we confirm the return, I will call you once again in regards to the payment so please keep note of that.	Then, as soon as I can check the return items, I'll give you a call again on your payment. Thank you very much.
はい、ではよろしくお願いします。	Okay, thank you.	Yes, I'm looking forward to it.
社のウェブサイトを立ち上げてはどうかと思うのですが、どう思いますか？	I'm thinking of setting up a website for the company but what do you think?	I'd like to start a company website, but what do you think?
近々作らなければとは思っていたんだけど、あまり詳しい者もいないようだし、後回しになっていた議題だね。	I was just thinking that we should make one soon, but we don't have anyone that knows a lot about it and is something that we've been pushing back.	I thought I'd have to make it soon, but nobody seems to know much, and it's a late topic.
この辺は田舎だしお年寄りも多いから、まだまだ紙媒体の広告に頼りがちだけど、そろそろ作った方が良さそうだ。	This area is rural and there are a lot of seniors so we still tend to rely on print advertisement but I think it is about time we made one.	Since this area is rural and there are a lot of old people, we're still inclined to rely on paper medium advertising, but it's time we made it.
あまり詳しくはないので、シンプルなデザインにはなると思いますが、作成してみようと思います。	I'm not that well versed so the design will be simple but I'm thinking of trying to make one.	I don't know much about it, so I think it's going to be a simple design, but I'm going to try to create it.
そうか、頼んだよ。	Okay, I'll leave it to you.	Okay, I asked you to do it.
井上さんも手伝ってあげてくれるかい？	Inoue-san, can you help him?	Will you help me, Inoue-san?
わかりました。	Okay.	Okay.
ウェブサイトが出来たら、電話帳の広告や、社用車にもアドレスを追加した方がいいですね。	Once the website is done, we should add the web address on the phone booklet, advertisement, and company car too.	When you have a website, you should add an address to your telephone book advertisement or to your company car as well.
社員の写真や会社の写真、作業が完了した家のビフォーアフターの写真などを出来るだけたくさん載せたいのですが。	I want to add photos of the employees, company and before-after photos of houses we worked on as much as possible.	I'd like to have as many photos of employees as possible, as many photos of companies as possible, as well as of a house that's completed.
写真なら一箇所にデータでまとまっているはずだから、そこからいくらでも使って大丈夫だよ。	We have the photos saved in one folder so you can use as much as you'd like.	You can use any number of photos from there, because you should have data in one place.
お客様の許可も得た方が良いですよね？	We should get permission from the clients too, right?	You'd better get your client's permission, wouldn't you?
そうだね、それは私から連絡しよう。	Yeah, I'll contact them on this.	Well, let's call it from me.
写真を見て、どの家を載せるか決まったらリストにまとめて持って来てくれるかな。	Can you look at the pictures and list up which houses you want to upload and show me?	Will you look at the picture and, when you decide which house to put up, bring it on the list?
わかりました。	Okay.	Okay.
そう言えば来年の電話帳への記載に変更がないかの確認メールが先日届いていました。	Come to think of it, we got an email the other day asking us if there will be any changes for next year's phonebook.	Speaking of which, I received an e-mail confirming that there was no change in the telephone book next year.
確か、変更があるなら今月中に連絡を入れなければいけないはずです。	I recall it saying that we need to let them know by this month if there will be changes.	I'm sure you'll have to contact me during this month if you have any changes.
では急いで作って、出来れば間に合わせたいですね。	Then we should make it quickly and hopefully be able to meet the deadline.	So I'd like to make it quickly and make it in time if I can.
でも意外と多いのが、スーパーとか市民会館に貼らせていただいているチラシだったり、近所の人がうちの会社で外壁を直したからっていう問合せなんだよね。	But surprisingly there are a lot that are flyers that we have posted at supermarkets and community centers, and we get inquiries that locals used our company to repair their exterior walls.	But there's a lot of surprises, because it's a flyer that's been put in a supermarket or a public meeting, or because a neighbor has fixed the outside wall at our firm.
ではそちらも出来上がり次第、サイトのアドレスを追加して貼り直します。	Okay, I will add the website URL and repost it once those are done as well.	Then as soon as it's finished, I'll add the site's address and put it back on.
私が通っている整体の病院にも名刺を置いてくれるって言ってたから、それも記載を追加しないとね。	The chiropractic hospital that I go to said they can let me leave business cards there so we should add it on there too.	You said you'd put your card in an orderly hospital where I'm going, so you'd have to add a note.
ウェブサイトが出来上がってからも忙しくなりそうですね。	It seems we will be busy once the website is finished too.	I'm afraid I'll be busy after the website has started.
予約もウェブ上で取れるように将来的にはする予定ですが、まだそこまでの知識がないので、どうしましょう？	I plan on adding a feature so we can take reservations online in the future but I don't have that much knowledge on it so what should we do?	I'm going to make an appointment on the web in the future, but I still don't know that much, so what should I do?
とりあえず問合せ先に社の番号、予約までは取れなくても問い合わせをウェブ上で出来るようになっていると良いかな。	Well let's at least have our company number in the contact information and have them be able to contact us over the web even if it's not taking reservations.	Anyway, I hope you'll be able to make the calls on the web even if you don't get the company's number or appointment at the end of the week.
それぐらいなら大丈夫だと思います。	I think I should be able to do something like that.	I think I'll be fine about that.
お客様がウェブで問い合わせをすると、社のメールに通知が来るように出来ます。	I will make it so we will get a notification on our company email when a customer makes an inquiry over the web.	When customers make calls on the web, they can be notified of their e-mails.
ではその返信などを担当する者も決めて置いた方が良さそうですね。	Then we should decide who will be in charge of replying those.	So I think it's better if the person in charge of the reply should decide.
ウェブサイトが出来上がったら、もう一度会議を開きましょう。	Let's have another meeting once the website is done.	Once the website is set up, let's hold another meeting.
では田中さん、井上さん、よろしくお願いします。	Alright, I'll leave it to you guys Tanaka-san and Inoue-san.	Then please say hello to Tanaka and Inoue.
新しいお弁当屋さん出てたよ。	There is a new bento place.	There was a new lunchery out there.
どんな感じ？	What's it like?	How's it going?
タイとベトナムとラオス料理の融合って感じ。	Kind of like a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian cuisine.	It's like a blend of Thai, Vietnamese and Laos food.
でも作ってる人はタイ人だったから、タイ料理がお勧めかも。	But the person making it is Thai so Thai food might be good.	But the man making it was Thai, so Thai food might be recommended.
えー、私ベトナム料理の方が好きなんだけどな。	Oh, I actually like Vietnamese food though.	I like Vietnamese food better.
でもジュリーが好きなのはフォーでしょ。	But Julie, you only like pho, right?	But Julie's favorite is Foe.
汁の麺類は弁当っていうか、持ち帰りにすると美味しくないよね？	Don't you think a noodle and soup for take out wouldn't taste good?	Soy sauce is either lunch, or it's not delicious when you bring it home, is it?
そうだね、じゃあ何がお勧め？	Right, then what do you recommend?	Well, what do you recommend?
今日はパッタイ買ってきた、味見する？	I bought pad-thai today, do you want to try it?	I bought some pastries today. Would you like to taste it?
する、ありがとう。	Yes, thank you.	Thank you very much.
美味しいね、私も見てこよ！	This is good, I'll go take a look too.	It's delicious. I've seen it too!
薬味の匂いが強いのはやめた方がいいよ。	I'd avoid the ones with strong herbal smells.	You shouldn't have the smell of spices strong.
うちの食堂狭いから、匂いが気になる人もいると思う。	Our cafeteria is small and there are people who would not be happy with the smell.	Some people are worried about the smell of our dining room because it's too small.
オッケー。	Okay.	Okay.
グリーンカレーと生春巻き買ってきた！	I bought green curry and summer roll.	I bought a green curry and a fountain of life!
美味しそう！	That looks good.	It looks delicious!
2人とも何食べてるの？	What are you two eating?	What are you two eating?
タイ料理、ビルの目の前の弁当屋台に新しく増えたみたいです。	Thai food, there is a new bento stall in front of the building.	It looks like we've added more to Thai food and to the lunch table in front of the building.
美味しいですよ！	It's good!	It's delicious!
カロリー考えずいっぱい食べられる細身女子はいいねー。	I'm jealous of skinny girls who can eat what a lot without worrying about the calories.	I like thin girls who can eat a lot of calories without thinking about it.
それってセクハラとか、何ハラとかわかんないけどタブーワードじゃない？	Isn't that like sexual harassment or some sort of harassment, and it shouldn't be something you should say, right?	I don't know if that's sexual harassment or whatever, but it's a taboo, isn't it?
お、容姿について話すのはやめとくか。	Oh, I guess I shouldn't talk about appearances.	Don't talk about your appearance.
そうだよ、最近何かとうるさいから気をつけな！	Yeah, you should be careful as that's something the company is pretty stringent on.	You're right. You're making a lot of noise these days, so be careful!
それにしても、うちの社食はなんで主食1品、副菜2品なんてめんどくさいルールになったわけ？	But still, how come our company cafeteria has an annoying rule of only 1 main dish and 2 side dishes?	But how did our food get to be one of the main foods and two side vegetables?
バッフェ形式だとケンみたいに食べすぎる人がいて、採算取れなくなったんじゃない？	Because if we have a buffet, people like Ken will eat too much and maybe they aren't able to make a profit?	People eat too much, like Ken, and don't they?
勘弁してよー、俺そんなに食べないよ。	Oh please, I don't eat that much.	Come on, I don't eat so much.
みんな知ってるよ、皿に毎回大盛りなの。	We all know that you always put a lot on your plate.	Everybody knows it. It's a big plate every time.
腹が減っては仕事はできぬ！	You can't work if you're hungry!	You can't work when you're hungry!
でた、戦国時代か。	There it is, you and your Sengoku period quotes.	So, we're at war?
隣のビルの事務所に転職しようかな。	Maybe I should go work at the office in the building beside from us.	I think I'll change jobs in the office of the building next door.
噂ですよね、隣のビルの食堂は美味しいって。	They say that the cafeteria is the building next to us is really good.	It's a rumor, isn't it? The dining room in the next building is delicious.
そう、職場の環境って大事だよね。	Yeah, the work environment is important.	Well, the workplace environment is important, isn't it?
特に俺みたいな大食いには、食の環境ってとっても大事なわけよ。	Especially for a big eater like me, where the food environment is very important.	The food environment is especially important for eating big meals like mine.
うちら細身女子は、食べられる量が少ないから余計中身重視なのよ。	Us slim girls can't eat a lot so we're more focused on the content.	Our skinny girls have less food than they can eat, so they're more important to their contents.
だから、うちの社食が毎日じゃ、いくらタダでも生き抜いていけないわけ。	So, if we eat at the company cafeteria everyday, we can't survive even if it's free.	That's why our food can't survive for free on a daily basis.
俺はタダより美味い飯はないと思う。	Well, I think there is no better meal than a free meal.	I don't think there's any better food than for free.
って事で、社食とってこよっと。	So, I will go grab some of the company meal.	That's why I'm going to eat food at the office.
今日はケンさんの嫌いなグリービーンズ盛り盛りのおかずですよ。	They have loads of green peas that you don't like as the side dish today.	Ken doesn't have the glybes that he doesn't like today.
えー、俺も弁当買いに行かないとかな？	Oh, maybe I have to go buy a bento too?	Well, I guess I should go buy lunch, too.
ケン、昼休み終わっちゃうよー。	Ken, lunch break is almost over.	Ken, I'm going to finish my lunch break.
よお、海瑠、今日はお疲れさん。	Hey, Kyle, good work today.	Hey, Seagulla. Good work today.
あれ海棠部長、もう帰られたのかと思ってましたが。	Oh, Kiichi, I thought you've left already.	I thought you'd already left.
ワークショップの件でまだ何か？	Do you still have something you'd like to ask about the workshop?	What's the matter with the workshop?
いや特に、お前と話がしたかっただけ。	Not really, I just wanted to talk to you.	No, in particular, I just wanted to talk to you.
この後まだ仕事か？	Are you still working after this?	You still working after this?
今日は確か...	I believe I have....	I'm sure today...
いえ、打ち合わせが金曜に延期になったんでした。	No, a meeting has been postponed until Friday.	No, the meeting was postponed on Friday.
今日はこれで終わりですね。	I'm done for the day now.	It's over for today, isn't it?
じゃ、一杯付き合えるな。	Then, you can join me for a drink, huh?	Then don't go out for a drink.
相変わらず強引ですね、部長。	You always push me too much, Kiichi.	You're still strong, aren't you, Chief?
な、久しぶりだろ？	Oh well, it's been a long time, you know?	It's been a while, isn't it?
まあ、断る理由はないですね。	Well, I have no reason to say no.	Well, there's no reason to refuse.
お前も飲むのは嫌いじゃないだろうに。	You rather like drinking, don't you?	You don't hate drinking, do you?
場所と相手によりますよ。	It all depends on where and with whom I drink.	It depends on where you are and who you're dealing with.
じゃ、俺はお眼鏡にかなったんだな？	So I passed your test, I guess?	So I got glasses?
ええ、喜んでください。	Yeah, you should be proud.	Yes, please be happy.
私は結構繊細で、人を選ぶタイプなので。	I'm quite sensitive and particular about people.	I'm very sensitive and picky.
はは、俺相手にそんだけの口がきければ上等だよ、海瑠。	Ha-ha, not bad if you can talk to me like that, Kyle!	If you're good enough to talk to me like that, I'm better.
入社の時からあなたみたいな疲れ知らずの上司に連れ回されましたからね。	I had been taken around by a tireless boss like you since I started working.	I've been taken around by an untiring boss like you since I joined the company.
誰でもたくましくなります。	Anybody would be tough.	Anyone will get sick of it.
お前みたいに反抗的だが真面目な新入り仕込むのは楽しかった。	I enjoyed training disobedient but earnest newbie like you.	It was fun to introduce serious newcomers, even though they were rebellious like you.
そうですね、８年の長きに亘って。	You did, for eight long years.	That's right, after eight years.
お陰様で、今ではどんなお偉方も平気ですよ、かなりクセのある方でも。	Thanks to you, I can deal with any important people now, even pretty difficult ones.	Thanks to you, all the great people are fine now, even if they're pretty old.
じゃ、今のお前があるのは俺のお陰って事だな。	That means you owe what you are today to me, right?	So it's thanks to me that you are now.
部長、あなたのそのプラス思考には敵いませんよ。	No one can think as positive as you do, Kiichi.	Boss, I don't mind your plus-up thinking.
ああ、お前に言いたい事がある。	Well, I have something to say, Kyle.	Oh, I have something to say to you.
お前が経営企画に引っ張られた時、あそこがエリートコースだから営業抜けさせたんだ。	When you got promoted to the corporate planning, I let you leave the sales because you'd get into the fast lane there.	When you were drawn to a management project, it was an elite course, so I made you go out of business.

ビクター、何をしてるの？	Hey Victor, what are you working on?	Victor, what are you doing?
先週から退職貯蓄の設定をしてるんだよ。	I've been setting up my retirement from the past week.	I've been setting up retirement savings since last week.
君はどう設定した？	How do you have your savings for retirement set up?	How'd you set it up?
僕は全部A社の株に投資してるよ。	All of mine is invested into Company A stock.	I invest all of my money in A company's shares.
A社は給与の4％までの貯蓄分には同額を補助してくれるから。	Company A matches everything that we put in up to four percent.	A company will lend the same amount of savings to four percent of its salary.
ビクター、君はどうしてるの？	How about you, Victor?	Victor, how are you?
うん、幾らかはA社の株に行くようにしてるよ。	Yes, some of mine goes into Company A stock.	Yeah, I'm trying to get some of it to go to A's stock.
ただ、自社株だけに投資したせいで、退職後の夢に敗れてしまった人々は沢山いるからね。	However, many people have watched their retirement dreams disappear because they invested only in the company stock of their employer.	There are a lot of people who have lost their post-retired dream simply because they invested only in their shares.
そういうわけで今調整しているところなんだよ。	That's why I've been working on mine.	That's why I'm adjusting.
君も分散させたほうがいいよ。	You've got to diversify, Tim.	You should spread out, too.
だけどお金は個人的な事じゃないか。	Well, I think money is a very personal matter.	But money isn't personal.
それに口出ししようっていうの？	Are you trying to get into my business?	And you want me to come out with you?
いやいや、そうじゃないよ。	No, no, no, not at all.	No, no, no. That's not true.
気をつけたほうがいいよって言いたかっただけだよ、ティム。	I'm just looking out for you, Tim.	I just wanted to say we should be careful, Tim.
ほとんどの人が君と同じようにするけど、長期的にみると効率よくないからさ。	Most people do exactly what you do, but in the long term, it doesn't make sense.	Most people do as you do, but in the long run, it's not efficient.
僕もそうしてたんだけど、色々調べ始めたんだよ。	I was doing it too, but I started doing some research.	I did, too, but I started looking into things.
そうか、じゃあどうしたらいいの？	Well then, what do you suggest?	Well, what do we do then?
いいかい、もしA社が失敗したら株の価値はなくなって全てを失うことになるだろ？	Here's the thing, if Company A fails, we lose everything and the stock will be worthless.	Look, if Company A fails, the stock will be lost and everything will be lost, won't it?
ターゲットデート・ミューチュアルファンドがいいよ。	Go with a target-date mutual fund.	I'd like to have a target date mutant fund.
何それ？	What's that?	What's that?
株や債券やその他の投資を組み合わせたファンドだよ。	It's a fund holds a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.	It's a fund that combines stocks, bonds, and other investments.
投資戦略に合わせて、時間が経つにつれてその組み合わせが徐々に変わっていくんだ。	Over time, the mix gradually shifts according to the fund's investment strategy.	As time passes, the combination gradually changes in proportion to the investment strategy.
ターゲットデートファンドは特定の退職日が頭にある人のためにデザインされた長期投資ファンドだよ。	Target date funds are designed to be long-term investments for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.	The target date fund is a long-term investment fund designed for those with a certain retirement date in mind.
へえ、調べてみよう。	Wow, I'll have to check it out.	Well, let's check it out.
自分でやってるの、それとも会計士を雇った？	Do you do that by yourself, or did you hire an accountant?	You do it yourself or you hire an accountant?
自分でやってるよ。	I've been doing it myself.	I'm doing it myself.
おはようございます、こちら倉庫担当のハリーですが、どのようなご用件ですか？	Good morning, this is Harry from the warehouse, how may I help you?	Good morning, this is Harry from the warehouse. What can I do for you?
おはようございます、ハリーさん、こちらマーケティング部のチャーリーです。	Good morning Harry, this is Charlie from the Marketing department.	Good morning, Harry. This is Charlie from marketing.
新年のカレンダーが届いたかどうか知りたいのですが。	I would like to know whether the new year calendar has arrived or not?	I'd like to know if the New Year's calendar has arrived.

あらら、じゃ、うちのオフィスにはいつ納品されますか？	Oh, so when it will be delivered to our office?	Well, when is it stored in our office?
業者によると一月の頭ごろには届くということです。	Our vendor said it will be delivered around early January.	According to the manufacturers, it will arrive at the head of January.
カレンダーが届いたらお電話いただけますか？	Would you please call me later when the calendar arrive?	Will you call me when your calendar arrives?
もちろん、そうします。	Sure, I will.	Of course I will.
確認のためですが、200部注文されましたよね？	Just to make sure, you ordered 200 pieces right?	To make sure, you ordered 200 copies, didn't you?
ええ、そうです。	Yes, that's right.	Yeah, that's right.
分かりました、あと、カレンダーは業者から一括してではなく、幾つかのバッチに分けて送られる予定だということもお伝えしておきますね。	Okay, I would also like to tell you that our vendor will not send the calendar to your office at once, but divided into several batches.	All right, I'll also tell you later that the calendar is going to be sent in pieces instead of in batches from the firm.
なので、200部注文されたとしたら、まず50部ほどお渡しできます。	So, maybe if you ordered 200 pieces, I can give you around 50 pieces at first.	So if you have 200 copies ordered, you can give them to them first of all about 50.
それから、次の日に業者からまた送られてきたら、さらに50部お渡しできます。	And then, if our vendor send it again the next day, I can give you another 50 calendars.	Then the next day, if the vendor sends me another copy, I can give you another 50 copies.
これは、全国の支社にもカレンダーを届ける必要があるからなんです。	This is because we also need to deliver the calendar to our branch offices throughout the country.	This is because we need to deliver calendars to branch offices around the country.
それに、支社に届ける時間が必要なので。	And we need time for delivery to our branch offices.	Besides, I need time to get to the office.
はい、分かりました。	Okay, I understand that.	Yes, I understand.
とにかくカレンダーが用意できたら教えてください。	Just please inform me when the calendars are ready.	Anyway, please let me know when the calendar is ready.
もうすでに遅れてますから。	Because it's already late.	I'm already late.
分かりました。	Okay.	Okay.
他に何かお手伝いできますか？	Is there anything else I can help you?	Can I help you with anything else?

皆さん、こんにちは、今日はお集まりくださいましてありがとうございます。	Hello all, thank you for gathering today.	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming together today.
ユーチン、今日はサイラーがいるので、全員英語でもいいでしょうか？	Yichin do you mind if we all speak English today as Sylar is here?	So, I'm going to ask you a question, and I'm going to ask you a question, and I'm going to ask you a question.
もちろん大丈夫です、サイラー、元気ですか？	Of course not, how are you Sylar?	Of course I'm fine, Cyler. How are you?
やあ、ユーチン、声が聞けて良かったよ。	Hi Yichin, good to hear your voice.	Hey, Yutin, it's good to hear your voice.
オーストラリアはどう？	How is Australia?	What about Australia?
実はうだるような暑さですよ。	Sweltering actually.	As a matter of fact, it's very hot.
東京の方がまだましでした、ここに戻るのはうんざりです。	Tokyo was much better, it sucks to be back here.	Tokyo was better, and I'm sick of coming back here.
さて、当社に関するあなた方のファンドの考えについて、全員同じ認識だということを確認するため、今日はお2人にも電話で参加してもらいました。	So I've got you 2 on the phone because I wanted to make sure we are on the same page regarding your fund's intentions with our company.	Now, to make sure that all of your funds have the same perception, I've had them join us on the phone today.
サイラーからは、懸念があるとのフィードバックを内々でいただいています。	Sylar has given me some feedback in confidence as to some concerns he has.	From Silas, I have been secretly asking for feedback that I have concerns.
そう、その件に関しては、サイラーからEメールをもらっています。	Yes, I got an email from Sylar regarding that.	Well, I've got an e-mail from Cizer on that matter.
サイラーの懸念はワン フェイホン社長に伝えてあり、フェイホンは御社の今後の方向性を考えるため過去の資金繰りを確認しています。	I've taken his concern to Wang Feihong and he has been looking at past financials to see where you may be heading.	His concerns are told to President One Feyhon, and Fyhon is checking his past funds to see where your company will be heading.
ここだけの話、もちろんサイラーもいますが、あまり良い状況ではありません。	Just between you and me, and Syler of course, this doesn't look good.	Between you and me, there are, of course, cylers, but it's not a very good situation.
ワン フェイホンは、恵子さんが、なんと言いましょうか、えー、慎重であることを主に気にしています。	Wang Feihong is mostly concerned at how, what's the word, um, careful, Keiko is.	Onefihon's main concern is what would you say to her, to be careful.
ユーチン、いいんです、言葉を選ばなくてもいいですよ。	Yichin, it's fine, you don't have to sugar coat.	It's okay. You don't have to choose a language.
恵子さんは頑固で時間がかかりすぎると。	She is way too stubborn and slow.	When you're stubborn and taking too long,
フェイホンは、そろそろ何らかの変革があることを期待していたのですが、悪くはなっていないにしろ、変わってないようで。	He was expecting some sort of change by now, but it seems to be the same, if not worse.	Fahon was hoping that there would be some change, but he didn't seem to be getting any worse, but he didn't seem to be.
ユジーナ、役員会議は最悪でしたよ。	Eugina, the board meeting was a disaster.	Junior, the board meeting was the worst.
恵子さんはアレックスを制止して、私の質問もうやむやにしました。	She was shutting Alex off, and dancing around my questions.	Aiko stopped Alex and stopped asking my questions.
ワン フェイホンがあの会議に同席することなんて考えられません。	I can't imagine Wang Feihong himself sitting at that meeting.	I can't think of a one-fihon sitting at that meeting.
あの人、爆発しますよ。	He will explode.	He's going to explode.
そうですね、あなたの質問には全く答えなかったと言ってましたね。	Yes, you told me she didn't answer any of your questions..	Well, you said you didn't answer your question at all.
当社は御社の最大の投資元の一つなのに、非常に失礼です。	It's very disrespectful as we are one of your biggest investors.	This company is one of the company's biggest investors, but it's very rude.
当社の経営陣のふるまいについては、深くお詫びを申し上げる以外に言葉もございません。	I don't know what to say other than I deeply apologize for their behavior.	I have nothing to say but apologize deeply for the behavior of our management.
恵子さん、大丈夫ですかね？	Is she okay though?	Are you all right, Aiko?
といいますと？	Meaning?	What do you call it?
えーと、あの方、その、よくわかりませんが、心身衰弱かなんかでしょうかね？	Well, is she, um, having some sort of, I don't know, breakdown?	Well, I don't know if he's weak or weak.
どうしてあそこまで自分の世界に行っちゃってるのか、理解できないんです。	I don't understand how she can live in la-la land that long.	I can't understand why I've been there.
何かおかしいですよね、恵子さんの健康状態が心配ですよ。	There seems to be something wrong and I'm worried for her wellbeing.	Something's wrong, isn't it? I'm worried about her health.
それは新たな見方ですね。	That's a new take.	That's a new perspective, isn't it?
そんなことは考えもつきませんでしたが、うん、それはありえるかも。	I didn't think about that, but yeah, that is a possibility.	I had no idea of that, but, yes, it could be.
個人的なことや病歴などはわかりませんので、なんとも言えません。	I don't know her personal affairs, or her medical history, so I can't really weigh in on that.	I don't know anything about personal or medical history, so I can't say anything.
ですが、当社の持続可能性のためには、策を講じる必要があることは確かで、当社の方向性はCファンドにかかっております。	But I do believe something needs to be done for the sustainability of our company and I am counting on C Fund for direction.	However, it's true that we need to take measures in order to sustain our company, and our direction depends on the funds.
とにかく、私としてはまだ、R社の状況を好転させるためにご一緒に取り掛かることを約束しますが、警告として言います、ワン フェイホン自身の関心は御社から離れていくと思います。	So I'm still committed to working with you to turn things around for Company R, but just as a heads up, Wang Feihong himself will not be focusing on you guys.	Anyway, I promise we'll work together to make R's situation better, but I'll warn you.
御社と協力することは許可されていますが、今後フェイホンからのインプットはないでしょう。	He has allowed me to work with you, but there won't be any input from him.	You are allowed to cooperate with your company, but there will be no further input from Faphone.
率直に言ってくださりありがとうございます。	Thank you for being straight with me.	Thank you for your frankness.
ユジーナ、この情報はここだけにしないといけませんね。	Eugina, I think this information should just be among us.	Eugenea, this information must be left alone here.
えー、実のところ、これはうちの経営陣への警鐘だと思いますね。	Well, I actually think this is a good wakeup call for them.	Well, actually, I think this is a warning to our management.
Cファンドが関心を失っていることを当社の経営陣が知ったら、きちんと対処するでしょうから。	If they know C Fund is losing interest, they may finally get their act together.	If our management finds out that C Funds are losing interest, they'll behave properly.
経営陣へ何と言うかはあなたにお任せしますよ、でも、私がここにいることを忘れないでください。	It's up to you what you tell management, but please remember I am still here.	I'll leave what to the management, but don't forget I'm here.
背水の陣は敷かない方がいいでしょう。	It's better not to completely burn bridges.	You shouldn't put up a line of backwaters.
お越しいただきありがとうございます。	Thank you for coming in.	Thank you for coming.
この前例のない天気に大打撃を受けて、屋根の中でパイプが溢れています。	This unprecedented weather is wreaking havoc on us, and there has been some overflow of pipes in the roof.	This unprecedented weather hit so hard that there's a pipe filling the roof.
周りに雨漏りが見られて、申し訳ありません。	I apologize for the leaks you see around you.	I'm sorry for the leak around you.
東京にある30％のビルでパイプの破裂があるとニュースで聞きました。	I have heard on the news that 30 percent of Tokyo's buildings have burst pipes.	I heard on the news that there was a pipe burst in 30 percent of the buildings in Tokyo.
地下鉄の駅にも至るところにバケツがありましたよ。	The subway station had buckets everywhere too.	There were buckets all over the subway station.
ええ、そうですか、面接に戻り、チームにあなたのことを紹介したいと思います。	Yes, so, I would like to get back to the interview and introduce you to our team.	Well, I'd like to go back to the interview and introduce you to the team.
こちらがシルベスター コー、当社の最高財務責任者です、そしてこちらがITチームを仕切っているカリム アフージャ。	This is Sylvester Ko, our CFO, and this is Karim Ahuja who leads the IT team.	This is Silvester Co, our CEO, and this is Callim Ahjui, who runs the IT team.

さて、今日私がお話しすることに皆さん大変興味をお持ちだと思うのですが。	So I'm sure you guys are eager to hear more about what I have to say today.	Now, I think you're all very interested in what I'm talking about today.
でも、始める前に、まず政府機関AとA社さんに、今日のイベントを共同開催してくれたことを感謝したいと思います。	But before I start, I'd like to thank Government Agency A and Company A for co-organizing today's event.	But before we start, I'd like to thank the Government A and Company A for jointly hosting today's events.
それから、この協定の実現のためにご協力くださったマイク モストウさんの仕事ぶりにもお礼を言わせてください。	Also, I'd like to thank Mike Mostow for his work in helping the deal materialize.	Then let me thank Mike Mosto for working with me to make this agreement come true.

モストウさん、大変なお仕事、ありがとうございました。	We appreciate your hard work Mr. Mostow.	Mr. Mosto, thank you for your hard work.
そして、今日ここにいて、クリスと彼のチームが新貿易協定について発表出来るのを喜ばしく思っています。	And I'm happy to be here today to have Chris and his team present to you the new trade deal.	And here today, Chris and his team are delighted to be able to announce the new trade agreement.
クリス、どうぞお話してください。	Chris, I will hand the floor back to you.	Chris, please tell me.
モストウさん、大変ありがとうございました。	Thank you very much Mr. Mostow.	Mr. Mosto, thank you very much.
さて、早速始めましょうか。	Alright, let's get right into it then.	Now, let's start fast.
CPTPPは11か国間の貿易協定です。	The CPTPP is a new trade agreement between eleven countries.	The CPTPP is a trade agreement between 11 countries.
その11のうち、7か国が正式に参加していますが、一方残りの4か国はまだ検討中の状態にあります。	Of the eleven, seven countries have already officially joined while the remaining four are still in the discussion phase.	Of those eleven, seven countries have officially participated, while the other four are still under consideration.
署名した7か国は、メキシコ、日本、カナダ、シンガポール、ニュージーランド、オーストラリア、ベトナムです。	The seven countries that have signed on are, Mexico, Japan, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and Vietnam.	The seven countries that signed are Mexico, Japan, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam.
残りの4か国は、ブルネイ、チリ、マレーシア、ペルーとなっています。	The four remaining are, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, and Peru.	The other four countries are made up of Brunei, Chile, Malaysia and Peru.
この貿易協定の目玉となるのは、多数の製品にかかる関税の引き下げもしくは撤廃です。	So the biggest feature of this trade deal will be the reduction or removal of tariffs on a large number of goods.	The highlight of this trade agreement is the reduction or elimination of customs on numerous products.
カナダにとって、大きな利点の一つは、アジア市場への肉製品にかかる関税の引き下げです。	For Canada, one of the biggest benefit is the reduction of tariffs for meat products in to the Asian market.	For Canada, one of the biggest advantages is the reduction in the tax on meat products to the Asian market.
カナダの主要市場の一つが日本なので、肉製品の貿易が大幅に増えることを予測しています。	One of Canada's key market will be Japan and we expect the trade of meat products to increase greatly.	Since one of Canada's major markets is Japan, we predict a huge increase in meat trade.
主要製品は牛肉と豚肉になります。	Key products will be beef and pork.	The main product will be beef and pork.
さて、関税だけでなく、協定は国々の間にその他の利益ももたらします。	Now aside from the tariffs, the deal also brings other benefits among the countries.	Now, not only customs, but also agreements bring other benefits to the nations.
例えば、これによって他の国の他の企業が、政府との契約に入札する機会を持つことができます。	For example, this will open up opportunities for other companies in other countries to bid for government contracts.	For example, this gives other companies in other countries an opportunity to sign a contract with the government.
典型的に、政府の契約には、地元の企業だけが入札できるのですが、これによって変わるでしょう。	Typically, government contracts can only be bid by the local companies but this will change that.	Typically, only local companies can bid on government contracts, but this will change.
そして、関税引き下げもしくは撤廃によって、外国企業が海外での政府契約入札においてより競争力をもつことが出来るようになります。	And with the reduction or removal of tariffs, it will allow foreign companies to be more competitive in bidding for government contracts abroad.	And due to tax reduction or elimination, foreign companies will be able to compete by means of government contracts overseas.
つまり、貿易協定は、単なる関税の引き下げや撤廃だけでなく、関係国の発展を促す他の機能も持つのです。	So the trade deal is not a simple reduction or removal of tariffs but has other features to promote the prosperity of the countries involved.	In other words, the trade agreement has not only the reduction and elimination of customs but also other functions that encourage the development of the countries involved.
何時間でも話すことができますが、まだまだこの先丸々一日ありますので、この辺で止めておきますね。	I could go on for hours but since we still have a whole day ahead of us, I will stop around here.	I can talk to you for hours, but there's still a whole day ahead of me, so I'll hold it around here.
では、この後は、政府機関Aの貿易委員の方々とのパネルセッションになります。	So after this, we will have a panel session with the trade commissioners from Government Agency A.	This will be a panel session with the government agency A's Trade Officers.
彼らは貿易協定の利点に関する見通しを教えてくれ、企業が利用することのできるいくつかの政府プログラムについて説明してくれます。	They will provide their insight on the benefits of the trade deal, and explain some of the government programs that companies could use.	They tell us the outlook on the advantages of trade agreements and explain to us some government programs that companies can use.
これらは、輸出業者が新しい市場へ進出するのに利用できる可能性のあるものだと思います。	These would be things that exporters could potentially use to expand to a new market.	I think these are things that exporters can use to advance to new markets.
パネルセッションは、私の後ろにある部屋で開かれますので、この後、どうぞそちらに向かってください。	The panel session will be held in the room behind me so please head on over after this.	The panel session will be held in the room behind me, so please return to it.
ありがとうございました、そして、皆さんが今日のイベントで多くを学ばれることを願っています。	Thank you and I hope everyone learns a lot from today's event.	Thank you, and I hope you can learn a lot at today's events.

I don't want to disappoint you, but I have a sales report for next week, and I have an exhibition to prepare, and I don't have time to take on it right now.
もし、時間があったら、何か手早くできる案がないかなと思って。	If you have the time, I was hoping you might be able to whip something up?	I thought if I had time, I could do something faster.
僕の思い違いでなければ、そのプロジェクトを指揮ってませんでしたか？	If I remember correctly, weren't you the one who spearheaded that project?	If I hadn't made a mistake, wouldn't you have led the project?
だったら、その過程で役に立った人の方がいい仕事をするんじゃないでしょうかね。	Surely someone so instrumental in its development would do a better job?	Then someone who was useful in the process would do better work, wouldn't he?
そうだけど、グラフィックデザインは得意じゃないのよ。	Yes, but graphic design is not my forte.	Yeah, but I'm not good at graphic design.
それに、今は、大事に育ててきた製品をお客さんにお披露目する展示会に全力を注がないといけないの。	Plus, I now need to put all my effort into things like the trade show, to help get my baby released to consumers.	And now I have to put all my effort into an exhibition that shows customers what I've grown.
はーい、わかりましたよ。	Okay, I understand.	Yes, I understand.
大丈夫だと思います、そういう仕事は好きだし。	It shouldn't be a problem, and I do enjoy that kind of work.	I think it's okay. I like that kind of work.
そうよ、M社との契約のときにすごく良いデザインしたの覚えてる。	Yes, I remember what a great job you did on the design work for the M contract.	Yes, I remember that I designed it very well when I signed a contract with M Corporation.
あなたに任せておけば、素晴らしく仕上がると思う。	I know it will be done well if I leave it in your hands.	I think if I leave it up to you, I'll finish it very well.
はあ、ですが、今、僕、インフルで休んでいるマークの仕事もやっていることを忘れないでくださいよ。	Yes, well don't forget I'm also covering for Mark while he's off with the flu.	Oh, but don't forget that I'm doing Mark's job, which I'm resting at Inful.
もし、マークの取引先から何か来たら、そちらの仕事を優先しますよ。	If anything comes through from one of his clients, that will have to take priority.	If anything comes from Mark's trading account, I'll put your work ahead of yours.
はい、もちろん。	Yes, of course.	Yes, of course.
今日、昼食後から始めらるか確認してみます。	I'll see if I can make a start after lunch today.	I'll see if I can start after lunch today.
ありがとうスコット、すごく助かる。	Thanks Scott, I really appreciate it.	Thank you, Scott. It's very helpful.
何か質問があったらいつでも聞いて。	I'll be on hand if you have any questions.	Whenever you have questions, ask them.
準備でちょっと外出するから、メールで連絡してもらうことになるかも。	I'll be out of the office for a bit with the preparations, so you might have to reach me by email.	I'm going out for a little while to get ready, so I might have him text me.
わかりました、大丈夫です。	No worries.	Okay, I'm fine.
さて、皆に集まってもらって、進捗状況を聞きたかったのです。	So, I just wanted to touch base with everyone, and see what stage everyone is at.	Now, I wanted everyone to come together and hear what was going on.
シモーヌ、メーカー探しはうまくいってるかい？	Simone, how's it going sourcing a manufacturer?	Simone, what's going on with the manufacturer?
順調です、中国に強力な見込み会社がいます。	Pretty good, I have some promising leads in China.	It's going well, there's a strong potential company in China.
連絡をとった工場は、送ったデザインをもとにCNC装置で必要な型を作れることがかなり確実なようです。	One factory I spoke to is pretty confident they can create the shapes we require with their CNC machines, based on the designs I sent them.	It seems pretty sure that the factory that contacted you can build the type based on the design you sent out on the CNC device.
そこの会社、デザインがかなり初期段階のものだと知ってるんだよね？	They know the designs are a very early work in progress though, right?	You know, the company there, the design is quite early, don't you?
最終的なデザインはかなり違ったものになりそうだけど。	The final design is likely to be quite different.	The final design is going to be quite different.
ええ、そのことは伝えてありますし、最終的なデザインがどのような感じになりそうかわかったときに特注治具をデザインすればいいのではと提案していました。	Yes, I made them aware of that, and they suggested we also design a custom jig when we know what the final design will look like.	Yes, I've told you about it, and I suggested that you design a custom-ordered modifier when you know what the final design looks like.
ふむふむ、いい案だな。	Hmm, that's a good idea.	Hmm. That's a good idea.
そうなんです、そうすれば、向こうもすぐに生産に入れますね。	Yeah, it would help them get the production started right away.	That's right, and they'll be in production soon.
アサ、君のチームはどうなってる？	Now, Asa, what's been going on in your team?	Asa, what's going on with your team?
えー、先週初めの段階で、予定より遅れていたんです。	Well, at the beginning of last week, we fell behind schedule.	Um, at the beginning of last week, I was behind schedule.
チームのメンバーとは既に話し合って、より良いやり方を決めましたので、金曜日には遅れを取り戻しました。	This is something I've already discussed with my team, and we came up with some better practices, and were back on track by Friday.	I've already talked with my team members and decided to do better, so I've got a late date on Friday.
良かった。	That's great.	I'm glad.
それで、火曜日に一般客を招いて、いろいろな素材や色の組み合わせを試してもらい、いろいろな特徴も説明しました。	Then, on Tuesday, we invited some members of the public to come and trial the different materials and color combinations, and we explained the various features.	So on Tuesday, we invited a public to try out a combination of materials and colors, and we explained many features.
すごく貴重なフィードバックももらえたので、デザインチームとも共有しておきました。	We gained some really valuable feedback, which we have shared with the design team.	We had such valuable feedback that we shared it with the design team.
そう、イアンは今日は参加できなかったんだが、その件に関しては繰り返し感謝してたよ。	Yes, Ian couldn't make it today, but he wanted to reiterate how grateful he was for that.	Well, Ian wasn't able to participate today, but he repeatedly thanked me for it.
フィードバックを聞いて、彼もチームも正しい方向に向かっていると確信できたと言ってたし、次に取り掛かるべきことについて指示したそうだ。	He said the feedback gave him and his team confidence that they are moving in the right direction, and has informed them what they need to focus on next.	When he heard the feedback, he said he was sure that both he and his team were headed in the right direction, and he told them what to do next.
良かったです。	Great.	I'm glad.
最後に、バネッサ、何か共有することはありますか？	Lastly, Vanessa, do you have anything to share?	Do you have anything to share with Vanessa?
えーと、皆さんご存知のとおり、商品名についてすごく良いブレーンストーミングのセッションができまして、当社のブランドとコンセプトをとてもよく反映している候補名がいくつか上がりました。	Well, as you all know, we had a great brainstorming session for the product name, and came up with some options that we thought reflected our brand and the concept really well.	Well, as you all know, we have a really good Blainsting session on product names, and a few candidates have come up that reflect very well our brand and concept.
そうか。	Yes.	I see.
ですが、残念なことに、一押しだった候補については、既に同じ商品名があるということで、その後法務部から連絡を受けて却下されました。	Unfortunately, the legal team has since got back to us and rejected our number one candidate, as there is already a product with that name.	Unfortunately, the candidate who tried to push it already had the same product name, so after being contacted by the Justice Department, he was rejected.
そして、もう一つの有力候補はスペイン語では下品とみなされるようで、振り出しに戻ってしまいました。	Another favorite could apparently be deemed offensive in Spanish, so it looks like it's back to the drawing board.	And another major candidate seems to be considered inferior in Spanish and has returned to the start.
心配するな、まだ時間はある。	Not to worry, it's still early days.	Don't worry, there's still time.
さて、この辺で切り上げるとするかな。	Right, let's wrap it up there.	Well, let's round up around here.
２週間後にまた集まって、進捗を報告してもらいます。	We'll reconvene in 2 weeks to share what progress we've made.	We'll meet again in two weeks to report our progress.

メールは先週送りました。	I sent them an email last week.	I sent my email last week.
もし返事がなかったら今週金曜日にフォローアップする予定なんです。	I'm planning to follow up with them on Friday this week if I don't hear back.	If there isn't an answer, I'm going to follow up this Friday.
先方に電話してみるのは？	Why don't you try calling them?	Why don't you call them?
実は担当者さんが今週は国外にいるので、メールに返信もらえるのを期待してたんです。	Actually the person in charge is out of the country this week so I was hoping he'd reply my email.	The fact is, since the person in charge is out of the country this week, I was hoping to receive an email reply.
彼は今ヨーロッパに居て、電話で連絡するのはちょっと難しいんですよ。	He's in Europe right now and it's a bit hard to reach him by phone.	He's in Europe now, and it's a bit difficult to contact him by phone.
というか、自分が出張の時に誰から電話かかってきてほしくないんですよね。	I mean, I wouldn't want someone calling me when I'm on a business trip.	I mean, I don't want anyone calling me when I'm on a business trip, do I?
特に寝てるときとか。	Especially when I'm sleeping or something.	Especially when you're sleeping.
そうか、それはそうだな。	Okay, fair enough.	That's right, that's right.
でもこの件、フォローアップをするの忘れないように。	Be sure to follow up on this though.	But don't forget to follow up on this matter.
東京でうちのチームが返事を待ってるから、少なくとも今週末までにどうなっているか連絡したほうがいい。	Our team in Tokyo has been waiting for a reply and we should at least let them know what is up by the end of this week.	Our team is waiting for an answer in Tokyo, so at least let us know how it will be by this weekend.
はい、わかりました。	Yes, I understand.	Yes, I understand.
どちらにしても金曜日に東京のチームに報告します。	I'll update the team in Tokyo on Friday regardless.	Either way, I'll report it to the Tokyo team on Friday.
ありがとう。	Thank you.	Thank you.
やあローラ、今ちょっといい？	Hey Laura, can we talk for a bit now?	Hello, Laura. Can I talk to you for a second?
うん、いいよ！	Yeah, sure!	Yeah, it's okay!

あっ、そういえば、お休みどうだった？	Oh by the way, how was your holiday?	Oh, by the way, how was your day off?

あはは！	Haha!	Ahaha!
最近は家でも作ろうとしてレシピをひたすらググってるわ。	He's now relentlessly googling the recipe so that he can recreate it.	I've been trying to make some recipes at home lately.
いいね！	Oh that's nice!	That's nice!
僕の分も作ってくれるように言っといて。	Make sure he cooks some for me too.	Tell her to make some for me too.
もちろん！	Definitely!	Of course!
オッケー、えっと、来週にT社とのミーティングをしたくて、君がいつ空いてるか知りたかったんだよね。	Ok, so, I wanted to set a meeting with Company T next week and I was wondering when you would be available to attend.	Okay, well, I want to have a meeting with T company next week, so I wanted to know when you were free, right?
先方はいつでも大丈夫みたいだから、僕たちの都合で決めていい。	Basically they can do any day so it's up to us.	They seem to be ready at any time, so you can decide on our convenience.
ああ、そうだよね、外に出れる日が、ちょっと待ってね、予定確認する。	Oh yeah, I will be able to go out, give me a sec, let me check my schedule.	Oh, you're right. I'll wait for the day when I can get out. I'll check my schedule.
オッケー、水曜日と木曜日は外出できる。	Ok, I can do Wednesday and Thursday.	Okay, I can go out Wednesday and Thursday.

ありがとう！	Thanks!	Thank you!
すみません、新しい文房具がほしいんですけど。	Excuse me, I would like to get some stationery.	Excuse me, I'd like a new stationery.
どんな種類の文房具？	What kind of stationery?	What kind of writing equipment?
赤い水性サインペンが欲しいんだけど。	I want a red non-permanent marker.	I'd like a red water signature.
備品棚に在庫なかった？	Didn't you see it on the supply shelf?	You didn't find it in the cupboard?
探してみたんだけど見つからなくって。	I looked for it but didn't find it.	I tried to find it, but I couldn't find it.
倉庫に在庫があるかもしれない。	We might have some in the storage.	There might be storage in the warehouse.
すぐに必要？	Do you need it soon?	Do you need it right away?
できれば早めに欲しいな。	The sooner the better.	I'd like it earlier if I can.
じゃあ、今見てくるけど。	Ok, I will go see it now.	I'll go check it out now.
お願いします。	Please do.	Please.
それと、ついでにもう一ついい？	Can I ask you one more favor?	And one more thing?
何？	What is it?	What?
こっちは急ぎじゃないんだけど、ハサミも新しいのが欲しい。	This is no rush, but I would like a new pair of scissors.	This isn't a rush, but I want a new scissors too.
ハサミも備品棚になくて。	There weren't any scissors on the supply shelf either.	I don't even have scissors in the cupboard.
新しいハサミは備品棚に置いてないよ。	We don't keep new scissors on the supply shelf.	I'm not putting the new scissors in the cupboard.
備品棚においてあるのは基本的に消耗品だから。	We only keep consumable goods on the supply shelf.	Because what's in the furniture cabinet is basically the waste.
そうなんだ、どうすればいい？	I see, what should I do?	Well, what do you want me to do?
サインペンと一緒に倉庫の在庫を見てみるよ。	I will see if there are some along with markers.	I'll take a look at the storage space along with the sign pen.
もしあったら、すぐに渡せるけど。	I will get a pair for you right away if there are any.	If it were, I could give it to you right away.
なかったら業者に今日発注するから、明後日届くと思う。	If not, I will place an order from the supply company and should receive them tomorrow.	If it weren't, I'd order it today, so I think it'll be delivered the day after tomorrow.
了解です。	I gotcha.	Yes, sir.
あ、そうだ、備品棚の持ち出し表、全部の欄が埋まってたよ。	Oh, another thing, the take-out chart was completely filled.	Oh, yeah, I found all the boxes in the storage cabinets.
新しい用紙を出しておいた方がいいよ。	You should probably get a new one out.	You had better put out a new piece of paper.
ありがとう、早速やっておくよ。	Thank you, I will get to it right away.	Thank you. I'll do it fast.
うちの会社のエントランスって殺風景ですよね。	Isn't the entrance to our company a little drab?	Our company's entrance is a killer landscape, isn't it?
掃除はしているけど、シンプル過ぎるっていうか。	It gets cleaned regularly but it is too plain.	I do cleaning, but it's too simple.
まぁ、華やかな感じじゃないよね。	Well, it's definitely not vibrant.	Well, it doesn't look Chinese, does it?
エントランス入ったら、社名があって応接セットと内線電話だけですからね。	When you come into the entrance, all you see is the company name, the reception furniture, and the telephone.	When you enter the entrance, there's a company name, and it's just an interviewing set and an inside phone.
一応、観葉植物もあるけどね。	Well, a plant is there too.	There's also observational plants.
でも、この観葉植物も会社が移転した時に取引先からお祝いで頂いたものですし。	But we got this plant as a gift from our client when our office moved.	But this observation plant was celebrated from its place of business when the company moved.
ちょっと枯れてきちゃっている部分もありますよね。	Some of the leaves are dying though.	Some parts are a little dry, aren't they?
高田さんは、結構色んな会社訪問してるじゃないですか？	Takada-san, you have visited many companies, haven't you?	Mr. Takada visits a lot of companies, doesn't he?
印象に残っている会社のエントランスとかあります？	Do you remember any company that has an impressive entrance?	Do you have any transfers from the company that's left in your mind?
会社の規模によって全然違うから、一概にうちの参考にはならないけど。	Since it varies greatly depending on the size of a company, it might not be very useful.	It depends on the size of the company, so it doesn't really refer to us at all.
今までで一番インパクトがあったのは、J証券かな。	The most impressive one by far is J brokerage.	The most influential thing I've ever seen is the J Securities.
外資系の大手投資銀行だから、全く参考にはならないんだけど。	It is a large international brokerage firm, so it's not helpful to compare though.	Since it's a major investment bank in foreign sources, it doesn't really help at all.
どんな感じなんですか？	How was it?	What's it like?
ワンフロアすべて受付。	The whole floor is dedicated to the reception area.	The whole one floor receptionist.
しかも、東京駅隣接のビルの１８階で一面ガラス張りだから見張らしのいいこと、いいこと。	In addition, it's 18th floor of a building that is right next to Tokyo Station with glass windows, which offers a breathtaking view.	And since the 18th floor of the building next to Tokyo Station is glassy, it's good to keep an eye on it.
受付のカウンターに女性が２人座っていて、受付が終わるとホテルのロビーの用なソファーに案内されて。	There are two female receptionists sitting at the front desk, and once you sign in, you will be guided to the sofa in an area that reminds you of a hotel lobby.	There are two women sitting at the reception counter, and when they're finished, they're led to a suitable sofa in the hotel lobby.
オフィスフロアに案内されるまで、優雅に待つという。	You can wait elegantly until you get guided to the office floor.	They're going to wait elegantly until they're led to the office floor.
高級ホテル並みのホスピタリティ。	As hospitable as a luxury hotel.	The hospice of an expensive hotel.
それは凄すぎますね。	That sounds awesome.	That's too great, isn't it?
じゃあ、もうちょっと身の丈にあったレベルで、よかったと思った会社はありますか？	Can you think of any company that is more like our level then?	So, what company did you think was good at the level of your height?
外資系ヘッジファンドのH投資顧問かな。	Foreign hedge fund managing company H might be it.	A H investment consultant for a foreign hedge fund.
どんな感じでした？	How was it?	What was it like?
日比谷のホテルに隣接しているオフィス棟に入っているんだけど。	It's in a building adjacent to a hotel in Hibiya.	I'm in the office building next door to a hotel in Ejidani.
そんなにエントランスが広いわけではなく、ちょうどうちの会社くらい。	The entrance isn't that big, it's probably the same size as ours.	It's not that big an entrance. It's just our company.
とにかく品があったよ。	It is very classy.	Anyway, there was some goods.
ドアを開けると、社名のロゴが掛かっていて、ガラスのテーブルに内線電話があったよ。	When you open the door, you see the company logo hung up and a telephone placed on a glass table.	When I opened the door, there was a company name logo on it and there was an internal phone on the glass table.
うちと一緒じゃないですか。	That sounds pretty similar to ours.	Isn't she with us?
あと、大きな花瓶にいつも生花のアレンジがあって、いい香りがするんだよね。	And there was a fresh flower arrangement in a large vase, and it smelled wonderful.	And then there's always an oven of fresh flowers on a large vase, and it smells good.
きつい香りじゃなくて、ほんのりフローラル。	It wasn't overpowering, just enough floral scent.	It doesn't smell hot, it's just a little soft.
嗅覚をくすぐるの、有効ですよね。	Olfactory stimulation can be useful.	It works, doesn't it?
生花のアレンジメントを飾るくらいだったら、うちも真似できるじゃないですか？	Can we borrow their idea and add a fresh flower arrangement?	If only we'd used to decorate fresh flowers, then we'd be able to imitate them.
じゃあ、ちょっと片付けて試験的にやってみる？	Then should we straighten up and do it as a trial?	Well, let's just clean it up and try it out on the exam, shall we?
周りの反応を見てみようかな。	Let's see how people react to it.	Let's take a look at the reaction around us.
いいですね、やってみましょうよ。	Sounds good, let's do it.	Okay, let's try it.
野田さん、ちょっとご相談なんですけど。	Noda-san, can I ask you something?	Noda-san, I'm going to ask you a few questions.
はいはい、何でしょう？	Yes, what is it?	Yes, sir. What is it?
来月１５日に、A証券さんが本社移転するんだよね。	My client, A Securities, is moving their headquarters on the fifteenth of next month.	On the 15th of next month, Mr. A Securities will be transferred to the headquarters.
御祝を贈りたいんだけど、どうすればいい？	I'd like to send them a gift.	I'd like to give you a present. What do you want me to do?
品物と予算は決まっているんですか？	Do you know what you want to send and how much you want to spend?	Do you have any goods and budgets?
いや、逆にいつも何を贈っているのかなと思って。	I was wondering what you always send out as gifts..	No, on the other hand, I was wondering what you always give me.
そうですね、オフィス移転の場合は観葉植物が多いでしょうか？	For a move, how about a decorative indoor plant?	Well, is there a lot of phytoplankton in office transfers?
グリーンレンタルの業者を利用している会社も多いですけど、喜ばれますよ。	There are many firms who rent potted plants for their offices, but most still seem very happy to receive something like that as a gift.	Many companies use green renters, but they're pleased.
特に、会議室や応接室が沢山あるオフィスだとインテリアとして重宝されますよ。	Especially if they have many conference and meeting rooms, they are perfect as decorations.	Especially if there's an office with lots of conference rooms and reception rooms, it's valued as an intelligence.
それに、観葉植物だと長期間置いてもらえますからね。	They also last for a long time.	Besides, you can keep them for a long time with ophthalmic plants.
あと、贈り主の名前が入った立て札を付けたままにしてあると、当社の名前がその会社に訪れた方の目につきますしね。	We can also add a plaque with our company name with the gift which will show their visiting clients our relationship.	And if you leave your gift's name on a bid, you'll find our name on the company's list.
なるほどね。	I see.	I see.
種類でいうと、パキラやユッカ、ベンジャミンなんかが多いですかね。	We usually choose pachira, yucca and ficus benjamina...	In a variety of species, do there are many Paquia, Yucca, and Benjamin?
予算は１万５千円から２万円くらいでしょうか。	Our budget is usually somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 yen.	Is the budget anywhere between 15,000 and 20,000 yen?
種類を言われても想像できないけど、うちのエントランスにあるような植物って感じ？	I'm not familiar with those plants but are they like the ones in our entrance lobby?	I can't imagine being told the kind of plant that's in our entrance?
そうですね、無難な感じです。	Yes, something pretty ordinary.	That's right. It's not difficult.
じゃあ、予算は１万５千円で、種類は任せるよ。	You can choose which kind and let's spend 15,000 yen.	Then the budget is 15,000 yen, and I'll leave the type to you.
ちょっと大きい鉢植えを１つ贈っておいてくれる？	Let's also choose a big planter for it.	Can you give me a little bit of a big plant?
了解しました。	OK, I will do that.	Yes, sir.
立て札に記入する名前はどうしましょう？	What name should I ask to put on the plaque?	Let's see if we can figure out the name to fill out.
社長名でよろしく。	Please put the president's name.	Please give me your boss's name.
わかりました、早速手配しておきます。	Got it, I will make arrangements immediately.	All right, I'll arrange it quickly.
今日からこちらでお世話になる小泉です、よろしくお願いします。	My name is Koizumi, pleased to meet you, I am starting today.	It's my pleasure to be here today. It's very nice to meet you.
新人研修担当の武藤です、よろしくお願いします。	I am Muto, in charge of new recruits, pleased to meet you as well.	I'm Toto, who's in the training department. It's very nice to meet you.
ではまず小泉さん、調理場に入る前にこの帽子を被ってください。	Koizumi san, please wear this hat before entering the kitchen.	First, Mr. Koizumi, please put on this hat before entering the kitchen.
髪の毛がはみ出ないように帽子に全部髪の毛を入れてくださいね。	Please make sure that no hair is showing.	Please put all your hair in your hat so that your hair doesn't come out.
髪のピン留めは付けてて大丈夫ですか？	Is it OK to put hair clips in?	Are you sure you can keep your hair on?
帽子の中に入っていれば問題ありませんよ。	As long as it's inside the hat.	If you're in the hat, there's no problem.
次に石鹸で3分間しっかり手を洗ってからアルコールを手に吹き付けてください。	Next please properly wash your hands with soap for 3 minutes before disinfecting with alcohol.	Next, wash your hands thoroughly with soap for three minutes before spraying alcohol on your hand.
こんなに徹底した衛生管理を行うんですね。	You take such care of hygiene!	You have such a thorough health care program, don't you?
食中毒を防ぐためにはなにより衛生管理の徹底が基本ですからね。	We basically need perfect hygiene to avoid food poisoning.	It's the basics of health care to prevent food poisoning.
じゃあまずはお弁当のご飯から盛っていきましょう。	Let start packing rice for the bento boxes.	Let's start with lunch.
炊飯器から200グラム、この計りで量ってこの容器にいれてもらえますか？	Will you scoop 200 grams of rice, weigh it on this scale, and put it into the container?	Can you put 200 grams of rice in this container with this measure?
200グラムぴったりって難しいですね。	It's hard to be exactly 200 grams.	It's hard to say 200 grams exactly.
215グラム以内だったら誤差は気にしなくて大丈夫ですよ。	As long as it's within 215 grams, don't worry about the difference.	If you're within 215 grams, you don't have to worry about the error.
ただし少ないのは厳禁です。	But make sure it is not less.	But few things are strictly forbidden.
たまにお客さんで家でご飯の量を量って足りないとクレーム出す人がいるんです。	Otherwise, some customers weigh the amount of rice and complain that there isn't enough.	Sometimes there are customers who don't have enough to eat at home.
わかりました、気をつけます。	I understand and will be careful.	Okay, I'll be careful.
ご飯が盛れたらこの湯煎されたレトルトの具をご飯の上に載せてください。	After the rice, put this heated the boil-in-the-bag ingredient onto the rice.	When the rice is served, put this steamed leather on top of the rice.
これは何のどんぶりを作っているんでしょうか？	What dish are we making?	What's this doing?
中華丼ですね、うちのスーパーの人気商品です。	A Chinese donburi which is one of the most popular product at our supermarket.	That's China China, isn't it? It's one of our supermarkets.
載せました、これで良いでしょうか？	Here it is, is this good?	Let's see if we can do that.
これだと真ん中に具が固まっているのでご飯の上に均等に載るようにしてください。	The topping is all in the middle, make sure it's spread evenly over the rice.	With this, the material is fixed in the middle so make sure it is placed equally on top of the meal.
最後に右端に漬物を乗せたら蓋を閉じます。	Please place the pickles on the right side and then put a lid on it.	The lid will be closed if you last place a broom at the right end.
これで完成でしょうか？	Is this done?	Is this it?
いいえ、商品シールを貼ります。	No, we still need to put the product sticker on.	No, I'll put a product seal on it.
この中華弁当500円って書いたシールでしょうか？	"Is it this ""Chinese bento box 500 yen"" sticker?"	Is it a seal that says 500 yen for this Chinese lunch?
いえ、これは中華弁当ではなくて中華丼です。	"No, this is a ""Chinese bowl"" not a ""Chinese bento box""."	No, this isn't a Chinese lunch, it's a Chinese Chinese lunch.
シールの貼り間違いが最近多く起きているので品名と値段はしっかり確認してください。	People have been applying the stickers inconsistently recently so please make sure that you're matching the stickers and food correctly.	Please make sure that your name and price are correct because there's been a lot of slips on the seal recently.
わかりました、シールは容器のどのあたりに貼るって決まってるんですか？	I will be careful, is there a particular position for the stickers?	Okay, so, where is the seal supposed to be put around the container?
中身が見えるように、シールは邪魔にならない右端でお願いします。	Yes, always make sure the sticker is visible the right hand side.	So that you can see what's inside, please use the seal at the far right where it's not in the way.
これで出来上がりなので、出来上がったら売り場に並べます。	So as this is done, we bring it out to the counter.	It's finished, so I'll set it up in the market.
並べる場所は決まってるんでしょうか？	Any place in particular?	Do you know where to line it up?
エビチリやチャーハンの並んでいる中華コーナーに並べてください。	Please place it with the rest of the Chinese food in the corner with the chili shrimps and fried rice.	Please line it up in a Chinese corner lined up with shrimp chili and chahan.
中華コーナー内であればどこに並べても大丈夫ですよ。	Anywhere in that section should be fine.	If you're in a Chinese corner, you can line it up anywhere.
作ったばかりの商品は同じ商品が並んでいれば後ろに並べた方がいいんですよね。	We just made this one so should it go to the back of the shelf?	If the product we just made is in line, then it's better to put it in the back.
通常のスーパーなら先入先出なのでそうなると思います。	Normally, most supermarkets apply a first in first out system.	I think that would be so because normal supermarkets are ahead of us.
うちのスーパーは作りたての新しいものを提供することで他と差別化しています。	We differentiate ourselves from other supermarkets by providing freshly made ones.	Our supermarket is discriminated against by providing freshly made things.
なので新しいものは古いものより手前に並べてください。	Please place the newly made items in front of the older ones.	So, put new ones in front of the old ones.
わかりました、並べてきました。	I understand, I went and placed it with the rest of them.	All right, I've come in line.
では同じ中華丼をあと10個作ってください。	"OK then, please make 10 more of the same ""Chinese donburi""."	Then please make ten more Chinese Chinese yen.
わかりました。	Alright.	Okay.

それまでに家具製品に関するページを仕上げれそう？	Do you think you can finish up the page in regards to the furniture products by then?	Will you be able to finish the page on furniture products by that time?
それは問題ないと思います。	I don't think that will be a problem.	I don't think that's a problem.
デザイン作業の大半は完了させてあります。	Most of the design is already done.	Most of the design work has been completed.

みんな、輸出へのプランを考えてきてくれましたか？	Did everyone think about an exporting plan?	(Applause)
考えてきたんですが、初めてのことなので中々難しかったです。	I did think about it but it was pretty hard as it was my first time.	I've been thinking about it for the first time, and it was pretty difficult.
では、小宮君からお願いしてもいいですか？	Okay, can we start with you, Komiya-kun?	May I ask you from Omiya?
はい、分かりました。	Yes, okay.	Yes, I understand.
僕はやはり初回の実験的な輸出であるということから、シンガポールに住む日本人をターゲットとした今日本で販売している商品の輸出が良いのではないかと思います。	I still think the first trial export should target Japanese people living in Singapore and export the products we sell in Japan today would be good.	Since I'm still my first experimental export, I think it's better to export goods sold today in books that target Japanese people living in Singapore.
なるほど。	I see.	I see.
日本人をターゲットにするということで、今ある既存の商品をそのまま輸出することができます。	By targeting Japanese people, we can simply export the existing products that we have.	By targeting Japanese people, you can export existing goods as they are.
現地の日本人が集まりやすい場所に販売箇所を絞ることで、経費も削減できると考えます。	If we narrow down our sales point to places where Japanese people tend to gather in the local area, we should be able to reduce our expenses too.	I think we can reduce expenses by narrowing down sales places to local Japanese people.
私も小宮さんの意見に賛成です。	I agree with Komiya-san's idea.	I agree with Mr. Omiya.
村田さんの案も聞かせてもらえますか？	Can you tell us about your idea too, Murata-san?	Mr. Murata-san's idea, too?
私もまずは現地に住んでいる日本人をターゲットにしてみてはどうかと思います。	I think we should first target Japanese people living locally as well.	First of all, I think we should target the Japanese who live there.
狭い国なので、日本人がよく行くスーパーに協力してもらって販売するのが一番現実的かと思います。	It's a small country so I think if we can get supermarkets where Japanese people go often to cooperate with us and sell through there will be the most realistic.	Since it's a small country, I think it's the most realistic thing to have Japanese supermarkets work together and sell it.
佐藤部長、質問です。	Sato-san, I have a question.	Chief Sato, I have a question for you.
小林君、どうしましたか？	What is it, Kobayashi-kun.	Mr. Komori, what's the matter?
このチームはまだただの有志の集まりで正式なチームではないと思うのですが、予算はありますか？	This team is still formed with volunteers and is not an official team but do we have a budget?	I don't think this team is still just a volunteer group, but do you have a budget?
今後の方向性次第で社長と総務に直談判する形になると思います。	I think it will depend on the direction we take from now and have the president and the general affairs department decide.	I think it's going to be a form of having a face-to-face interview with the president and the president depending on the direction we're going.
でしたら、実際に自分たちがシンガポールに行って、現地調査を兼ねたサンプル配布を行うことは可能でしょうか？	If that is the case, will it be possible for us to go to Singapore and do field research as well as distributing samples?	So can we actually go to Singapore and do a sample distribution of our field research?
現地でどの様なものが売れているのか、今後の参考にしたいですし、日本人以外にもサンプルを直接配ることで現地の生の声が聞いてみたいです。	I'd like to learn about what kind of things are sold locally for future reference, and listen to the actual comments of locals by distributing samples directly to non-Japanese people.	I'd like to take a future look at what is sold on the ground, and I would like to hear the native voice of life by passing out samples directly to other Japanese people.
それはいい考えですね、私も賛成です。	That's a good idea, I'm in favor of that.	That's a good idea, I agree.
僕も賛成です。	I'm in favor of that too.	I agree with you too.
なるほど、私もいい考えだと思います。	I see, I think that's a good idea as well.	Well, I think it's a good idea, too.
では、このプランをベースに社長と総務を納得させることができるような計画を立てましょう。	Okay, let's use this plan as a base and form a plan that can convince the president and the general affairs department.	So let's make a plan that will convince the president and the president based on this plan.
安田さん、遅くなってすみません。	Yasuda-san, sorry I am a little late.	I'm sorry I'm late, Akida-san.

新幹線代は大きいもんね。	Shinkansen fare isn't cheap.	The Shinkansen Line is big, isn't it?
領収書をなくした場合は、こっちの書類を記入してもらう必要があるの。	In case of a lost receipt, this different form needs to be filled out.	If I lose my receipt, I need you to fill out this document.
領収書がない理由も書かなければならないんですね。	I need to write down the reason for the lost item, right?	I also have to write down why there isn't a receipt.
そうだね、正直に紛失したと書くしかないね。	Yes, you just need to be honest and write you lost it.	Well, the only way to be honest is to write that you've lost it.
分かりました。	I gotcha.	Okay.
では、今からこれも記入してきますね。	Then I am going to go fill out this form now.	Then I'm going to fill out this.
ちょっと待ってて。	Wait a second.	Wait a minute.
他に記入ミスがないかちょっと確認するね。	Let me check to see everything else is filled out correctly.	I'm going to make sure there's any other input mistakes.
お願いします。	Please do that for me.	Please.
ここの現地のホテルの金額ってどのレートを使ってる？	What rate did you use for the local hotel fee?	What rate do you use for a local hotel?
ネットで見た今日のレートで計算しました。	I used the rate I saw on the Internet today and calculated it.	I calculated it by the rate I saw on the Internet today.
ごめんね、領収書を切ってもらった日のM銀行のレートで計算してもらってもいいかな？	Sorry, can you calculate it using the M bank's rate on the day you got your receipt?	I'm sorry, can I ask Bank M to calculate the rate at which I got my receipt cut off?
分かりました。	Yes sir.	Okay.
それ以外は問題なさそうだから、その2点だけ訂正お願いします。	Everything looks great other than that, so please fix those two things.	Other than that, there seems to be no problem. Please correct only those two points.
石井さん、ちょっとすみません。	Ishii-san, do you have a moment?	Excuse me, Iwai-san.
はい、何でしょう。	What is it?	Yes, what is it?

もしインフルエンザとかだったら、しばらくお休みになるかもしれないですよね。	Perhaps you'll have to take a break from work if your child has the flu.	If it's the flu, it might take a while.
そうですね。	I might have to if that's the case.	That's right.
でも、まだ保育園ではインフルエンザの話を聞かないので、大丈夫だとは思うんですが...。	But I haven't heard any outbreak of the flu at the nursery, so I think it might be fine.	But since I haven't heard about the flu at day care school yet, I think it's all right...
まさかのインフルエンザだった場合は、とりあえず明日はお休みさせていただきます。	If ever my child does have the flu, then I'll have to take the day off tomorrow.	If it wasn't for the flu, I'd rather let you go to bed tomorrow.
あさっての金曜日は、主人がお休みなので、相談して出勤できるようにします。	My husband has the day off the day after tomorrow on Friday, so I'll make sure to show up to work by then.	Since my husband is absent tomorrow, I'll be able to talk to him and come to work.
請求書の出力がありますし。	I still have to finish the outputs for the invoices.	There's an output of the bill.
そうですか。	I see.	Is that so?
そうしてもらえると助かります。	It would be a big help then if you could show up on Friday.	I'd appreciate it if you could do that.
とにかく、迎えに行って、そのまま小児科に行ってきます。	I'll go pick my child up then and proceed to the pediatrician.	Anyway, I'm going to pick you up and go straight to the pediatrician.
診察が終わったら、明日行けるようでもお休みになるようでも、電話を入れるようにします。	I'll make sure to give a call whether I can come to work or not tomorrow once we have finished with the check-up.	After the examination, I'll try to make a phone call, whether I can go tomorrow or take a day off.

ねぇ、ちょっといい？	Hey, do you have time?	Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
どうしたの？	What's up?	What's wrong?
気になってる事があるんだけど・・	I've got something on my mind.	There's something I'm curious about.
何が？	Such as?	What?
最近、上田さんの出す領収書の数がとても増えてきているのよね。	I noticed that Mr. Ueda gives me so many receipts recently.	Recently, the number of receipts Oda-san produces has increased greatly, hasn't it?
それが全部、商談のための諸費用としてのなの。	He says they are for the company meetings.	That's all part of the expense for a business talk.
上田さん、そんなに忙しくしてたっけ？	Has he been so busy these days?	Mr. Ota, have you been so busy?
私が見る限り、そうだとは思わなかったんだけど。	I didn't think he was so busy as far as I know.	As far as I've seen, I didn't think so.
週末は、必ず商談のためと言って、レストランの領収書持ってくるのよ。	He gives me a restaurant receipt every weekend regularly, saying it's for a company meeting.	I always say it's for business purposes on weekends, and I bring in a receipt for a restaurant.
先週末なんて、あの三ツ星ホテルの中のフレンチのお店だったの。	It was a French restaurant in a three-star-hotel last weekend.	Last weekend was a French shop in that Mizoo hotel.
えー、なんて贅沢！	Wow, that's luxury.	What a luxury!
それに加え、六本木のクラブの領収書までよ。	Also, he gave me a receipt of a nightclub in Roppongi.	In addition to that, it's the receipt for the six-tree club.
まあ！	Gosh!	Oh!
こんな事が1ヶ月くらい続いてて、ちょっと怪しいなって思ってるんだけど。	It's been a month, so I've started to feel suspicious.	This has been going on for about a month, and I think it's a little weird.
どう思う？	What do you think?	What do you think?
聞く限りでは、ちょっと怪しいかも。	It sounds a bit dodgy from your story.	As far as I'm concerned, it might be a little suspicious.
でしょ？	Yeah.	Right?
どうしたらいいかな？	What shall I do?	What do you want me to do?
うーんと・・	Let me see …	Um...
上田さんの取引先はどこだったかしら？	Who is Mr. Ueda's client?	Where was Ota-san's deal?
U商社よ。	Trading company U.	It's a U.S. firm.
あれ、U商社との商談は２週間前にまとまったって聞いてるけど。	Eh, I've heard we had closed the deal with company U two weeks ago.	I heard you had a business deal with the U.S. firm two weeks ago.
そうだったの？	Is that so?	Did you?
私、確認の書類探してくるね。	I'll find a paper to confirm.	I'm going to go look for confirmation papers.
それを持って行って、上田さんに詳細を確認したらどう？	Why don't you take the paper and talk to Mr. Ueda to check the details?	Why don't you take it and check with Owada-san for details?
でも、ちょっと心細いな。	Well, I'm not sure if I can do it.	But it's a little narrow-minded.
上田さんは、支店長に気に入られているからといって、私たちには、横暴なところがあるから。	He is bit a domineering to us as he is a branch manager's favourite.	Oda-san is in love with the branch manager, because we have a mean spot.
確かにね。	True.	That's true.
私も、何度も嫌な思いしてるわ。	I've been offended by him many times.	I feel bad too many times.
そうだ、山本主任に相談して見たら？	Oh, how about speaking to Ms. Yamamoto for help?	Yeah, why don't you go talk to Chief Yamamoto?
それいい考え！	Ah, good idea!	That's a good idea!
山本さんは、上田さんより勤務歴が長いしね。	She's been working here longer than Mr. Ueda.	Yamamoto-san has a longer career than Ota-san.
彼女の言うことなら、上田さんも素直に聞くかもしれないね。	He might be listening to her obediently.	If what she says is true, she may listen to you too.
そうよ、もしその領収書が私用で使われたものだとしたら、とんでもないことだもの。	Yes, it'll be so wrong if the receipts were for private use.	Yes, if the receipt was used for personal use, it would be a big deal.
早速、山本さんに相談してくるね。	I'll have a word with Ms.Yamamoto now.	I'll go talk to Yamamoto right away.
うん、頑張ってね。	Good luck.	Yeah, good luck with that.
ありがとう。	Thanks.	Thank you.
今日は、慈善活動について話し合いたいと思います。	Today we'd like to discuss our charity activities.	Today, I'd like to discuss charity.
ご存知の通り、当社では年に一度発展途上国に行き、慈善活動をしていますね。	As you know, we go to a developing country every year for charity work.	As you know, we go to developing countries once a year and engage in charity.
それ以外に、何ができると思いますか？	In addition to that, what else can we do?	What else do you think you can do?
それは、国外限定でしょうか？	Is that limited to overseas activities?	Is it restricted?
それとも、国内でもいいのですか？	Or can we do something here?	Or is it good for the country?
どちらでもいいですよ。	Either will do.	It doesn't matter which way.
意見を聞かせてください。	Any ideas?	Please let me know your opinion.
私は、国内でのことですが。	I have something for domestic activities.	I'm talking about it at home.
会社でフードドネーションを募るというのはどうでしょうか？	How about making a food donation as a company.	What about asking for food in the company?
普段は仕事で忙しいので、どこかに行くというのは難しいと思います。	As we are all busy working, it's not easy to be away.	I'm usually busy with work, so I think it's difficult to go anywhere.
会社に大きな箱を設けて、使わない缶詰や、保存食を持って来て入れてもらう。	So we could put a large box and ask the employees to bring in some unwanted tinned or preserved food.	I'll have a big box set up in the company and bring out cans or stored food that I don't use.
これなら負担なくできるのでは？	I don't think it would cause much trouble.	I'm sure you'll be able to do this without burdening yourself.
それはいい考えだと思います。	That's a good idea.	I think that's a good idea.
以前、子供の学校でその様なフードドネーションウィークがありました。	My kid's school had a food donation week before.	There used to be such a hoodlumswake in children's schools.
かなりの数が集まったと聞きしたよ。	I heard they collected loads of donation.	I heard there were quite a few.
集まった食べ物はその後どうするのですか？	Where do we donate the collected food?	What will you do with all the food you've gathered?
近くの教会に寄付をしては？	We could bring them in to a local church.	Why don't you give a donation to the local church?
または、フードバンクをしているボランティア団体に持って行くのもいいのでは？	Or, we could send them to a volunteer group offering a food bank.	Or maybe we should take it to a volunteer organization that runs a food bank.
いいですね。	Sounds good.	That's nice.
確かに、わが町にもたくさんの路上生活者や、生活困窮者がいますもんね。	Actually, we can see lots of homeless or people on benefits in our area.	It's true that there are a lot of street people and people in need in our town.
身近な人を助けるというのは、とても大事なことですよね。	It's very important to help our neighbours, isn't it?	Helping people close to you is very important, isn't it?
実は、うちに使っていないたくさんの缶詰があるんです。	I have many unopened tinned food at home.	As a matter of fact, there are lots of cans that I don't use at home.
うちもですよ。	So do I.	It's ours, too.
もしもの時用に買っていて、全然使っていませんでした。	I stocked up some for the emergency, but forgot to use them up.	I bought it for a rainy day, and I didn't use it at all.
きっと社内でも、その様な人がたくさんいるでしょうね。	Maybe more people in our office are similar.	I'm sure there are a lot of such people in the company.
そうだ。	Oh!	That's right.
もう着れなくなった衣類も持って来てもらったらどうでしょう。	How about asking everybody to bring along the old clothes as well?	Why don't you bring me some clothes that you can't wear anymore?
特に、子供服は助かると思います。	Particularly, children's clothing is in demand.	I think children's clothes will be especially helpful.
賛成！	Agree!	Aye!
子供服は、すぐサイズが着れなくなってしまうし。	Kids quickly grow out of the clothes.	Children's clothes are soon out of size.
喜んでもらえることは、間違いないと思います。	So, I'm sure kids' clothes will be well accepted.	I'm sure you'll be pleased.
そうしましょう。	Okay, then we'll do.	Let's do that.
では、社内でドネーションを募るという事に決まりですね。	So, we've agreed to ask donation of food and clothing internally.	So it's decided to apply for a doodle in the company.
早速、社内メールを作って、みんなに配布します。	I'll work on an e-mail message and send it out to the employees.	Right now, I'm going to make an internal e-mail and distribute it to everyone.
二週間後の、月曜日から始めるというのはどうでしょうか？	Is it okay if we start on Monday the week after.	What about starting on Monday, two weeks from now?
いいと思います。	Yes.	I think it's good.
私は、ドネーションを入れる箱を用意しますね。	I'll find a box for the donation.	I'll get you a box to put donation in, won't I?
助かります。	Thanks.	Thank you very much.
たくさん集まるといいですね。	I hope we will have a lot of donation.	I hope we get a lot of people together.
そうですね。	Indeed.	That's right.
N社の玉元です。	Hi this is Tamamoto from Company N.	It's from the N company.
玉元さん、渋谷です。	Hi Tamamoto-san, this is Shibuya.	I'm Shibuya-san.
渋谷さん、お疲れ様です。	Hope you are well Shibuya-san.	Shibuya-san, thank you for your hard work.
ちょっと頼みたいことがあるけどいいかな？	Is it okay if I ask for a small favor?	Can I ask you a favor?
はい、なんでしょうか。	Yes, what is it?	I wonder.
明日の東京出張の飛行機の便、変更できるならしてもらえないかな？	Can I ask you to change my flight for my business trip to Tokyo tomorrow?	Would you mind changing your flight to Tokyo tomorrow if you could?
急に午前中に商談に行かないといけなくなってさ。	I suddenly have to go for a business meeting in the morning.	Suddenly I had to go to a business meeting in the morning.
わかりました、予定はJ航空の8時半名古屋発でしたっけ？	Okay, you're currently taking the one departing Nagoya at eight thirty via Airline B?	Okay, so your plans are to leave Nagoya at 8:30 on J.A., right?
いや違うな、8時ちょうど発のA航空だよ。	No, it's the one leaving around 8 o'clock via Airline A.	No, it's not. It's just an A flight from 8:00.
そうなんですね、午後の出発ならいつでもいいんでしょうか？	Okay, will any flight departing in the afternoon work?	Are you sure you don't mind if we leave this afternoon?
そうだね、商談は9時からだから2時間として12時半以降ならどの便でもいい。	Yeah, the business meeting is from 9 o'clock and should take 2 hours so any flight after twelve thirty will be good.	Well, business talks start at 9 o'clock, so I can make any flight after 12:30 for two hours.
ただ東京出張でも時間が沢山あったほうがいいので午後早めの便がいいかな。	But it would be better if I have more time for the business trip to Tokyo so maybe an earlier flight in the afternoon would be good.	I just wish I had plenty of time on my trip to Tokyo, so I'd like to make an early flight earlier this afternoon.
うーん、ANAの午後便で今見たところ1番早い空席が17時発ですね。	Hmm, I just checked the flight for Airline A and the earliest available flight is from 5 o'clock.	Um, on an AA flight this afternoon, I've just seen that the fastest seat leaves at 17 p.m.
そんなに埋まっているのかい？	Is it that full?	Are you sure it's buried like that?
残念ですがそのようですね。	Unfortunately yes.	I'm afraid so.
JALでも見てみましょうか？	Should I take a look at Airline B?	Would you like me to take a look at JAL?
頼むよ、17時は流石に遅すぎる。	Yes, please, 5 o'clock is a bit too late.	For God's sake, it's too late for a driftstone at 17 o'clock.
お待たせしました、JALでもこの日は夕方まで満席ですね。	Thank you for waiting, it seems Airline B is fully booked until the evening.	Sorry to keep you waiting, but at JAL this day is full until evening, isn't it?
何かイベントでもあるんでしょうかね。	I wonder if there is some event or something.	I wonder if there's an event.
困ったなあ、LCCとかでもないかな？	That's no good, is there any with the LCC?	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
LCC便ですね、お待ちください。	LCC flights, let me check.	It's flight LCC, isn't it? Please wait.
やっぱりありませんね、新幹線はどうなんですか？	No there aren't any, how about the bullet train?	I don't think so. What about the Shinkansen Line?
新幹線は不便だからあまり好きではないんだよな。	The bullet train isn't convenient so I'm actually not fond of it.	You don't like Shinkansen very much, because it's not convenient.
そうはいってもこの場合仕方ないんではありませんか？	Yeah, but what else can we do?	Isn't that what you're going to do in this case?
うーん、先方に連絡して商談は後日にしてもらうよ。	Hmm, I'll call the person I'm meeting and will ask to shift the business meeting to a later date.	Um, I'll contact them, and they'll talk to me later.
なので予約はこのままで大丈夫。	So you can leave the reservation as is.	That's why I'm okay with the reservation.
承知しました。	Understood.	Yes, sir.
それとあと一つ頼んでいいかな？	And can I ask you to do one more thing?	Can I ask you one more thing?
はい、なんでしょうか？	Yes, what is it?	Yes, sir?
明日の東京でのホテルなんだけど予約確認メール見たら喫煙ルームになってるんだよ。	It's in regards to the hotel in Tokyo tomorrow, I was looking at the confirmation email and noticed that it was a smoking room.	It's a hotel in Tokyo tomorrow, but when I get a confirmation e-mail, it's the smoking room.
俺が自分で予約した時にミスったんだと思う。	I must have made a mistake when I booked it.	I think I made a mistake when I booked myself.
ホテルに連絡して、禁煙ルームが空いてるなら部屋変更を頼んどいてもらえないかな？	Can you call the hotel and ask if there are non-smoking rooms available, and if so can you change the room?	Would you please call the hotel and ask me to change the room if there's a non-smoking room?
わかりました、どこのホテルでしょうか？	Okay, which hotel is it?	Okay, which hotel?
銀座のNホテルだ。	It's Hotel N in Ginza.	It's the N Hotel in Ginza.
わかりました。	Okay.	Okay.
ちょっと携帯の充電が切れそうなのでどうなったかメール送っておいてくれる？	My battery on my phone is running low so can you send me an email on what you find out?	I'm losing my cell phone charge, so can you text me what happened?
はい、それでは失礼します。	Okay, I'll get back to you on this.	Yes, I'll leave you then.
緑川さんお疲れ様！	Midorikawa-san, how are you!	Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Green River!
明日営業部は新入社員歓迎会なんでしょ、たくさん楽しんでおいでね。	So tomorrow is the sales department's new employee welcoming party, go have lots of fun.	The sales department is a welcome party for new employees tomorrow, so have a lot of fun.
私楽しみな反面ちょっと憂鬱なんですよね。	I look forward to it but I'm also a bit depressed.	On the other hand, I'm a little depressed.
なんでどうしたの、何か心配事でもあるの？	What's wrong, are you worried about something?	What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
なんか学生時代のサークルの飲み会とは違うんで粗相をしたらどうしようって。	It will be different from a drinking party from a club in my university days so I'm worried I will get out of line.	I don't think it's like a drink party in The Circle when I was a student, so what if I didn't?
そんなこと心配してたの？	You were worried about something like that?	Is that what you're worried about?
歓迎への感謝の気持ちを表して普通にいつもどおり楽しく過ごせばいいと思うわよ。	I think you can just express your gratitude to the party and just enjoy it normally as usual.	I think it's best to show your appreciation for the welcome and enjoy it as usual.
いつもどおりってそんなことだけでいいんですか？	Normally as usual, that's all?	Are you sure that's all that matters?
歓迎会ってみんなで仲良くするものでしょ、それにお互い知り合うものでもある。	You're supposed to have fun with everyone at welcoming parties, it's also to learn more about each other.	It's a welcome party and we all get along, and it's also something we get to know each other.
あんまりよそよそしかったりギクシャクしててもおかしな印象を持たれるだけよ。	They will have a weird impression of you if you are too uptight and awkward about it.	You can only make a funny impression if you're too distant and you're too glum.
そんなものなんですねー、普通が1番ってことですね。	So just like that, being normal is the best, right?	That's what it is, isn't it? It's usually the best.
なにか飲み会で新入社員がやらないといけないことってありますか？	Is there anything that a new employee must do at drinking parties?	Is there something new staff members have to do at a drinking party?
そうねー、気遣いができればいいんじゃないかしら？	Well, it would be good if you are attentive.	Well, why don't we just be concerned?
例えば取り皿が足りない人はいないかとか、お酒がまだ来てない人がいないかとか。	Like making sure everyone has an extra plate or making sure everyone has got their alcohol.	For example, who is missing a plate or who is not drunk yet?
グラスのお酒が減ってきたら足してあげるとか。	Pouring some alcohol in their glass if it's getting less.	Maybe I'll add you a glass of wine when it's low.
あれってどれぐらいになったら注げばいいんですか？	When should I be pouring it?	How long should I pour that?
3分の1とかですか？	Like one third?	Is it a third?
それとも完全にグラスが空になってからですか？	Or when the glass is completely empty?	Or after the glass is completely empty?
これ人によって好みがいろいろなのよね、私は空になってから派だけど。	People preferences varies but I'm the type that does it when it is empty.	These people have different tastes, don't they, after I've become empty?
特にどれぐらいっていうのはないのよね。	There isn't really a set amount.	I don't know how long it's going to take.
1回3分の1ぐらいになった時に注いでみればわかるんじゃない？	You will probably know if you try pouring it once when it is around one third.	If you pour it once, about a third of it, you'll find out, don't you?
嫌な人なら断るだろうし、そうじゃない人はそのままグラスを差し出すわよ。	People who dislike it will say no and those who are fine will just hand you their glass.	If you're a bad person, you'll refuse, and if you're not, I'll give you the glasses.
でもそこまで細かくグラスに目を光らせなくても気づいた時に注げばいいわよ。	But I don't think you have to be that detailed and attentive, just pour it when you notice it.	But you can pour it when you realize that you don't have to look so closely at the glass.
なるほど、わかりました。	I see, got it.	I see. I see.
やっぱり部長とか課長の席には率先してお酒を注ぎに行ったほうがいいんでしょうか？	Should I be pouring alcohol to managers or the section chief?	Should I take the lead in the chief's seat or in the chief's seat?
まあ1回くらいは行ったほうがいいわね。	I think it would be good to go at least once.	Well, you should go once or twice.
偉い人から順番に回るんですよね？	So I should go around in order in terms of rank?	You're going in order from a great man, aren't you?
そうね、基本は序列順ね。	Yeah, by rank in general.	Well, the basics are in order.
明日の会場はどこなの？	Where is the venue tomorrow?	Where's tomorrow's room?
S駅の側のHホテルの宴会場って聞いてます。	I heard it is at the banquet hall of Hotel H beside Station S.	I hear it's a banquet hall at the H Hotel on the other side of the station.
だったら丸テーブルで6名ずつぐらいで座ると思うわ。	Then I think there will be around 6 people sitting around a round table.	Then I think I'll sit down in six or so on the round table.
課長と同じ席になったらそこは序列気にせず課長のを先に注げばいいわ。	If the section chief is sitting with you then you can ignore the rank and just pour it for the section chief first.	When you're in the same seat with the Chief, you shouldn't worry about it. You should pour the section chief first.
それとあそこだとフレンチのコースだから周りのペースに合わせて食べてね。	Also, they serve a French course menu so make sure to eat at a pace that others are eating at.	And if it's over there, it's French, so eat at the pace around you.
妙に遅かったり早かったりするとマイペースだなって捉えられかねないから。	If you are oddly slow or fast, they may think you are the type that does things at your own pace.	Strangely slow, or fast, you can think of it as my pace.
わかりました、私男兄弟の中で育って食べるのが早いんですけど気をつけます。	Okay, I grew up with older and younger brothers so I eat fast but I will be careful.	Okay, I grow up and eat fast among my brothers, but I'll be careful.
最後にくれぐれもこれだけは覚えておいて。	Finally, be sure to remember this by all means.	Remember this one last thing, for the last time.
新入社員歓迎会だけではなくて今後会社の飲み会では酔っ払いすぎないこと。	Be sure to not get too drunk not just for new employee welcome party but for future company drinking parties.	Not just the welcome party for new workers, but at the company's drinking party from now on, it's not that you're too drunk.
酔っ払いすぎると自分が気づかないうちに変わってしまう人もいるから。	There are people who completely change without realizing when they get too drunk.	Some people change before they realize they're too drunk.
はい、アドバイスありがとうございます。	Okay, thank you for your advice.	Yes, thank you for the advice.
でもあそこの伊勢海老のクリームソースは最高よ、楽しんできてね！	But their lobster cream sauce is awesome, have fun!	But that ice cream sauce over there is the best! Have fun!
これはこれは谷中先生、いつもお世話になってます。	Hello Yanaka san, it's a pleasure, as always.	This one is always taken care of, Mr. Tani-sensei.
社長、こちらこそいつもお世話になっております。	Hello Miyajima san, the pleasure is all mine.	Mr. President, I'm always looking after you, too.
今日は健康診断についてちょっとお話ししたかったものでお伺いしました。	Today, I wanted to discuss the health examination situation with you.	I wanted to talk to you about a physical examination today.
そうか、社員に健康診断を受けさせないといけないんだよね。	Oh yes, we need to provide medical examinations for our employees.	I see. I have to get my employees to have a physical examination, don't I?
そうなんですよ、これは労働安全衛生法で義務付けられているんです。	That's right, it is mandated by the Labor Safety and Health Act.	That's right, it's required by the Work Safety Act.
長時間労働での健康障害が増えてるので、かなり厳しくなっていますね。	It's very strict now that there's been an increase in health disorders due to long working hours.	Since long-term health problems are increasing, they're getting pretty hard.
よしわかった、やろう。	Alright, then we must get this in order.	All right, let's do it.
会社指定の病院で受けさせればいいんだっけ？	Do we send them to one of the company approved hospitals?	I'm supposed to take him to a hospital that's designated as a company?
それもひとつの方法としてありますね。	That is one option.	That's also one way to do it.
あとは、会社で集団健診を実施か従業員各自に受診させてその結果を提出させるかです。	Or the company can organize a group health examination, or allow each employee to take an exam and submit results.	The next question is whether to perform group-uses at the office or to have each employee take a look at the results.
いろいろあるんだね、うちはどれがいいんだろうか？	I see, there are many options, which would you recommend?	There's a lot of things you can do.
御社であれば、加入してあるG県健保組合の指定医療機関での受診が望ましいですね。	I recommend using one of the G prefectural health insurance association approved medical institutions for your company.	If it's your company, it would be advisable to consult the G-prime Union's designated hospital.
一番手間がかからずにできる方法です。	That would be the easiest option.	It's the easiest way to do it.
それって健保組合の指定した医療機関じゃないとダメなのかい？	Would it have to be a medical institution approved by the health insurance association?	Does it have to be a medical institution designated by the Kendington?
そうですね、原則そうなります。	As a general rule, yes.	That's the principle, isn't it?
実はうちのクライアントにL病院があってね。	We have an L hospital as our client.	Actually, my client has an L hospital.
できたらそこで受けさせたらいいんじゃないかと思ったわけよ。	I was hoping we can use the hospital, if possible.	I thought maybe I should let him take it there if I could.
今リストを持っていますので調べてみます。	Let's see, I will check the list right now.	I have a list now, so I'll check it out.
うーん、L病院ですね。	Well, L hospital is...	Um, it's L Hospital, isn't it?
残念ながらリストには入っていないようですね。	Unfortunately is not on the list.	I'm afraid you're not on the list.
そうか、ここで受けさせるにはどうしたらいいかな？	Hum, how can we use this hospital?	Well, what can I do to make you accept it here?
この健康診断は会社が全ての費用を負担しないといけません。	The company would have to cover the costs for the health examinations.	This health examination requires the company to pay all the expenses.
なので私がL病院に事前に話をして社員さんから費用徴取をしないように伝えます。	I can contact L hospital and tell them not to charge the fees from the employees ahead of time.	So I'll talk to L hospitals in advance and tell them not to charge for their expenses.
ただ各自に受診させるので健康診断の必要項目以外を受診希望することもあります。	There might be incidences where they might request something other than what's required when the exams are done individually.	I'm just going to have each of you examine it, so I'm going to ask for a medical examination, except for the ones that need it.
例えばどういうケース？	Can you give me an example?	What kind of case, for example?
バリウムではなく胃カメラ検査を希望したりするケースですね。	For example, in a case when an employee chooses a gastroscopy procedure, rather than taking barium.	It's not barium, it's also a case where you want a gastric camera test.
この差額でプラス2万円になったりすることもあります。	The cost difference will be an additional 20,000 yen.	This difference may result in plus 20,000 yen.
なるほどね。	I see.	I see.
その場合はオプションになることを事前に社員さんに伝えておく必要があります。	We would need to inform the employees in advance that there are different options.	In that case, you have to tell your employees before you can tell them that it's an option.
私の方で、健康診断のお知らせのようなものを作りましょう。	I will draw up a memo for the health exam.	I'm going to make something like a health report.
よろしく、頼んだよ。	That would be great, thank you.	Nice to meet you.
受ける時期は皆一緒じゃないといけないのかい？	Would we need to get all of them to take the exam around the same time?	Shouldn't we all be together when we get this?
なかなか現場の都合もあって、皆一緒には難しいと思うんだよね。	I think it will be difficult for all of them to go around the same time due to site constraints.	It's very convenient on the scene, and I think it's difficult for all of us to work together.
それは構いませんよ、皆さんで揃えなくても問題ありません。	I  agree and  they won't need to do it at the same time.	It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you guys don't get it.
それとこれは法律上、受診時間中の賃金支払い義務はありません。	Also, it is not required by law to pay employees during the examination.	And this is not legally required to pay during the examination.
ただし、労働時間として取り扱い、賃金を支払うことが望ましいとされています。	But it is recommended that the company treat that time as work, and provide pay.	However, it is recommended that you treat it as a working time and pay your wages.
社員からすれば、会社からの命令で健康診断に行くという形になりますので。	Most employees consider it as a company requirement that they do the exam.	If you're working for the company, you'll be taking orders from the company to go to a health check.
わかった、勤務時間扱いにしよう。	I understand, we will treat it as working hours.	Okay, let's treat it like working hours.
では私は健康診断のお知らせができましたらまたご連絡します。	OK, I will let you know when I prepare the memo for the health exam.	Then I'll be in touch when I'm able to inform you of my health checkup.
ご苦労さん、よろしく頼むよ。	That would be great, thank you.	Thank you very much, thank you very much.
新人だからってどうして電話を率先して取らなくちゃいけないんですか？	Just because we're new, why do we have to take the initiative in picking up calls?	Why should I take the lead on the phone because I'm new?
手が空いている人が取ればいいだけじゃないですか。	Why can't whoever is available pick it up?	Isn't it just a matter of taking away someone who's free?
確かにそうですね。	That's true.	That's true, isn't it?
でも率先して電話を出る事によって先様に新しい人が入ったんだなと名前を覚えてもらえます。	But if you take the initiative and pick up, it will be a chance for the other party to know that a new person joined and to remember your name.	But by taking the initiative to answer the phone, you can remember the name of the new person first.
そして電話対応が良いとあなたの評価が回りまわって社外からも社内からも上がります。	And if the way you handled the call was good, your reputation will get better from outside and inside the company.	And your reputation for being good on the phone goes up from the company and from the company as well.
おお、それはいいですね。	Oh, that'd be nice.	Oh, that's nice.
ということで、電話対応お願いしますね。	So, please do pick up the calls.	So please answer the phone.
ではどうして僕たちが資料集めや必要な情報の選定をしなくてはいけないんですか？	Then why is it that we have to gather reference materials and pick out information?	So why do we have to collect data and select necessary information?
これは作家先生本人がするべきことですよね？	Isn't this something that the author should do?	This is what a writer should do, isn't it?
そうですね、アマチュアの作家さんはもちろんプロの作家先生でも自分でされる方はおられます。	Well, there are amateur authors and of course professional authors who do it themselves.	Well, if you're an amateur writer, of course, you're not going to do it yourself even if you're a professional writer.
でも私は作家先生に今目の前にある物語に集中してほしい。	But I want the author to focus on the story in front of them now.	But I want my writer to focus on the story right now.
資料集めは地味に時間がかかるものです。	Gathering reference materials does take some time to do.	The collection of material takes time to gather.
だからその時間を執筆に使ってほしいと、私は思っています。	So, I'd rather have the author spend that time writing.	That's why I want you to spend that time writing.
それに違う目線で資料を集め選定することは、作家先生の想像力を刺激する事にも繋がります。	Also, gathering materials and picking out the information from a different perspective can bring about a new idea for the author too.	Also, collecting material and selecting it with a different perspective, and stimulating the writer's imagination.
ただ資料を集めるだけじゃないんです。	So it's not just simply gathering materials.	It's not just collecting material.
そういった事も編集者の仕事だと、私は考えています。	I believe that things like that are part of an editor's job.	I believe that such things are part of the editor's job.
なるほど、そういう意味もあるんですね。	I see, there is such a meaning behind that too.	Well, that's what it means, isn't it?
ありがとうございます、佐々木さん。	Thank you very much Sasaki-san.	Thank you, Mr. Sasaki.
木檜さん、おはようございます！	Good morning, Satoru!	Good morning, Mr. Tokio!
おお、ピーターソンさん、朝から随分元気だね。	Hi, Ron, you're pretty hyper today.	Oh, Mr. Peterson, you've been very well since morning.
なんかあったの？	What's up?	What happened?
今度ウチの生体認証センサーがテレビに出るって知ってる？	Have you heard that our biometric sensor will be on TV soon?	Did you know that our biometric sensors will be on TV next time?
ああ、なんかそんな事誰かが言ってたっけ。	Ah, I've heard someone was saying something about that, I guess.	Oh, did someone say something like that?
木曜夜にやってるT放送のニュース番組に出るんだ。	We'll be on the news show for T Station every Thursday night.	I'm going to be on the T TV news show that's going on Thursday night.
あの番組の中で「今週の最先端技術」って紹介するコーナーあるじゃない？	"You know ""State of the Art Technology of the Week"" section in that show, don't you?"	There's a corner on that show that I'd like to introduce you to this week's state-of-the-art technology.
あ、それ私も結構見てますよ！	Oh, I watch that quite often, too!	Oh, I've seen a lot of that too!
ああ、そういえばこの間、AI使ったサイバー攻撃防御システムとかってF株式会社が取り上げられてたな。	Oh, yeah, F Corporation was on that show the other day, showing their cyber security system that uses AI or something.	Oh, by the way, the other day the F- share company was taken up with the AI cyber-resistant defense system.
そうね、あの時出てたFの人、話が上手かったわ。	That's right, that person from F was pretty good at talking.	Well, the F-man who was out at that time was good at talking.
実はあのコーナーって、一発撮りなんだって。	I've heard that section is actually shot in one go.	In fact, that corner is a single shot.
えー、でも結構突っ込んだ質問とかしてくるよね？	Wow, but they often ask some sharp questions, don't they?	Well, I'm going to ask you a lot of questions, aren't I?
この研究所って、機密保持契約のプロジェクト多いから何言うか気を付けないとだね。	This laboratory has quite a few of projects with non-disclosure agreement, so we have to be careful what we say, huh?	This lab has a lot of classified contracts, so I have to be careful what I say.
ウチのラボからは誰が出るの？	Who's going to be on the show from our lab?	Who's coming out of my lab?
多分長澤さんじゃないかな。	I guess Kaname would be the one.	I think it's Mr. Nagai.
彼、開発部長だし。	He's our Chief of the Development, too.	He's the development manager.
あのセンサーの事一番良く知ってるでしょ。	And he knows everything about our sensor.	You know that sensor best.
彼なら安心してテレビの前に座ってられるね。	Then I can relax in front of the TV if he'll be on air.	He can sit in front of the TV in peace.
あ、噂をすれば...。	Oh, speaking of the devil...	Oh, if you talk about it...
長澤さん、おはようございます！	Good morning, Kaname!	Good morning, Mr. Nagai!
おはよう。	Good morning.	Good morning.
みんな朝から集まって何の話？	What are you all chatting about gathering together?	What are you guys talking about getting together in the morning?
私は仲間はずれなのかな？	Am I missing on something here guys?	Do you think I'm out of company?
いえ長澤さん、ウチのセンサーがテレビで紹介されるって話をしてたんです。	Well, we were just talking about our sensor being introduced on TV, Kaname.	No, Mr. Nagai, we were talking about our sensors being introduced on TV.
ああ、あれか、みんな耳が早いね。	Oh, that, you guys have sharp ears, huh?	Oh, well, they're all quick to listen.
長澤さん、それっていつ放送されるんですか？	When is it going to be on air, Kaname?	When will that be broadcast, Mr. Nagai?
うーん、３週間くらい先のオンエアだったかな。	I think it'll be on about three weeks from now.	Um, it's about three weeks from now.
もう撮ったんですか？	Have they shot already?	Have you taken it yet?
いや、来週火曜日の午後のはずだ。	Not yet, it's supposed to be next Tuesday afternoon.	No, it should be next Tuesday afternoon.
テレビ局の撮影班がここに来るよ。	A camera crew is coming here from the TV station.	The film crew from the TV station will be here.
うわー、何処で撮るんですか？	Wow, where are they shooting?	Wow, where are we going to get this?
第一会議室だと思うよ。	I believe they'll shoot it in Meeting Room 1.	I think it's the first conference room.
先方がなるべく広くて明るい部屋がいい、って言ってたからね。	They said they'd prefer a spacious room with lots of light.	They said they wanted a room as large and bright as they could.
じゃあ、ボードとか少し片付けた方がいいですか？	Well then, should we put away some of the stuff like the whiteboard in the room?	Should I clean up the board or something?
大丈夫だよ、いつも通りが良いらしいから。	It's okay, they want to shoot in our usual setting.	It's okay, I heard that it's always better.
散らかってる研究室じゃなくて良かったね。	I'm relieved that they won't go into the messy lab.	I'm glad it's not a messed-up lab.
あー、なんでよりによってその日なんだ、僕出張なのにー！	Argh, why does it have to be on that day, I'll be gone on a business trip!	Ah, why is it that day? I'm out on a business trip!
ピーターソンさん、撮影関係ないでしょ。	You have nothing to do with shooting, though.	Mr. Peterson, it's none of your business.
だって、あのレポーターの女の子、ファンなんだよ！	Well, I'm a fan of that reporter girl!	Because that reporter girl is a fan!
お喋りしたいのは分かるけど、みんなあと10分で朝ミーティング、始めるよ。	I know you want to chat a bit more, but we have a morning meeting in 10 minutes, all right?	I know you want to talk, but everyone's going to start the morning meeting in ten minutes.
じゃ、今朝のミーティングはこれくらいかな？	Well, so that's about it for the morning meeting today?	So this is the best meeting I've had this morning?
あ、あと１点だけ、確認させてください。	Oh, I'd like to confirm one more thing.	Oh, please let me confirm just one more point.
来週のテレビ取材ですけど、どのセンサー出すんですか？	About the TV coverage next week, which sensor are we showing them?	Next week's TV interview, which sensor will you give me?
社長は最新のやつ出したがったんだけど...。	Well, Kentaro wanted to put out the latest ones, but....	The boss wanted to run the latest.
静脈認証のはまだテスト完全に終わってないですよ？	We haven't completed testing for the one with vein authentication yet, you know?	We're not done with the IV yet, are we?
ウチの３D顔認証の方はまだ開発中だし。	We're still developing 3D sensors for face recognition, too.	My 3D facial recognition is still developing.
だから、今F社のSフォンに乗せてる虹彩認証センサーを見せる事にしたんだよ。	So, we've decided to show our iris authentication sensor currently mounted on F Corporation's S phone.	That's why I decided to show you the iris authentication sensor that I put on F's Sphone.
最新のセンサーに関しては、ちょっと最後に話入れるくらいが安全かなって。	As for our latest sensors, it's probably safer to mention a little at the end of the coverage.	As for the latest sensors, I think it's safer to bring in the last word.
ふー、あの指紋認証の時みたいになったらって、心配してたんです。	Phew, I was worried if something went wrong like that time with that fingerprint sensor.	Well, I was worried I'd become like that at the time of the fingerprint authentication.
私はまだトラウマですよ。	I still carry that trauma, you know?	I'm still a trauma.
あーあれはヤバかった、生放送の番組だったしね。	Oh, that was chilling, and it was a live show, too!	Ah, that was terrible. It was a live TV show.
私、何の話か分からないんですけど。	I don't know what you guys are talking about.	I don't know what you're talking about.
指紋認証、ですか？	About fingerprint authentication?	Fingerprints, sir?
ああ、かなり前の話だから三居さんはまだ居なかったかも。	Oh, yeah, it was quite a while ago so maybe you weren't around then, Anna.	Ah, it was a long time ago, so Mr. Three might not be here yet.
10年くらい前でしたっけ？	About 10 years ago, I believe?	It was about ten years ago, wasn't it?
そう、当時ウチが開発したばかりの指紋認証センサー、今回みたいなテレビ番組が取り上げられたんだけど。	Yes, like this time, a TV show covered our fingerprint recognition sensor which we had just developed at the time.	Well, we just developed a fingerprinting sensor and a TV program like this one was taken up.
残念ながら、生放送の取材中にちゃんと作動しなくてね、その場でフォローも出来なくて。	Unfortunately, it didn't work out properly during the live report, and we couldn't cover for the trouble on the fly either.	Unfortunately, it didn't work properly during live broadcasts, and I couldn't follow it on the spot.
そう、それでこの研究所の評判ガタ落ちして、回復すんのに数年かかったんだ！	Yeah, this lab's reputation took a nosedive then, and we had to spend few years to recover!	Well, it took me a few years to get over this lab's reputation.
あの時も大塚社長が一番新しいの出したいって言ったんだよね。	Kentaro insisted that he'd show the latest product at the time as well.	President Oueo said he wanted to produce the new one, too, didn't he?
今回と違って、説得しきれなくて。	Unlike this time, I couldn't convince him not to.	Unlike this time, I couldn't persuade him.
でも、あれは田淵所長がセンサーの使い方も良く知らないのに色々触りまくってたのが大きな要因だよね。	But I think the big part of it was that Toru fiddled around with the sensor, even though he didn't know much about how to use it.	But that's a big factor because Chief Tanaka wasn't really familiar with how to use sensors.
あの人、研究所所長っていっても、肩書きだけの元お役人でしょ？	He's the director of this laboratory, but just a figurehead, a retired official, isn't he?	Even if he's a director of a lab, he's a former official with just a title, isn't he?
おいおい、言葉に気を付けなさいよ、ピーターソン君。	Whoa, you should watch your mouth, Ron.	Hey, hey, watch your mouth, Peterson.
だって真面目な話、田淵さん色々わかってないプロジェクトにいっつも口出して、迷惑かけるんですもん。	Well, seriously, he always intervenes in projects he doesn't really understands, and gets us into troubles.	I don't know what to do, but I keep talking about projects that I don't understand.
先週だって僕のF社でのプレゼン見るって、ついて来たんですけど。	Last week too, Toru followed me to see my presentation at F Corporation, though.	Last week, I saw a presentation at my F company, and I followed it.
いらん事ばっかり言うから、後から全部細々説明しなきゃいけなくて、スゴく余計な時間かかったんですよ。	He just kept telling them unnecessary things, so I had to spend so much extra time to follow up with explanations for each and every aspect.	I've had to explain everything later, since I've had to explain everything, so it took me a lot of time.
あー、それ私も先月の展示会でやられたわー！	Oh, he did that to me, too, at an exhibition last month!	Oh, that's what happened to me at last month's show!
全部知ってるフリして来場者に話しちゃうでしょ？	He spoke to participants as if he knew everything, you know?	You pretend you know everything, and you tell the audience, don't you?
ずっと気にして横からフォローいれなきゃいけなくて、ほんと疲れた!	I had to be on the watch and cover for him throughout the event, made me super exhausted!	I'm so tired that I've got to take care of it and follow it from the side!
表に出て話したいなら、もう少し勉強してからにして欲しいよねー。	He should learn more about our products if he wants to go speak in public.	If you want to come out and talk, you want to study a little longer before you do it, don't you?
まあまあ、みんなちょっと落ち着いて、そんなに彼を責めないで。	Well, everybody, calm down a bit, don't be so hard on him.	Well, everybody calm down. Don't blame him so much.
田淵さんも今度はちゃんとやろうって考えているみたいだから、きっと大丈夫だよ。	Toru is thinking of how he'd do better this time, so he should be okay.	You seem to be thinking of doing it right this time, so I'm sure you'll be okay.
え、ちょっと待ってください、大丈夫って何がですか？	Wait, wait a sec, what do you mean he'd be okay?	Wait a minute. What's okay?
あれ、さっき皆話してたでしょ？	Well, you were all talking about it, weren't you?	Hey, we were all talking earlier, right?
テレビに出るって、田淵さんが。	About Toru's appearance, on TV.	I'm going to go on TV. Mr. Tadashi-san says it's on TV.
まさか、今回の虹彩認証センサーも田淵所長が出るんじゃあないですよね？	You're not saying that Toru will be on the show this time with our iris recognition sensor, are you?	I don't think that's going to happen.
そうだよ、知らなかったの？	Yes, you didn't know?	Yeah, you didn't know?
いやいや、それは絶対無理ですって！	No, no, no, that's definitely impossible!	No, no, no, I can't do that!
イヤだ、あんな悪夢はもう嫌だー！	No, way, no more of that nightmare!	No, I don't want that nightmare anymore!
所長、今度はラボ全体をトラウマに陥れる気なんですか？	Is he trying to traumatize the whole Lab now?	Director, are you going to shock the entire lab this time?
では、本日の会議を始めます。	Hello everyone, let's get started with today's meeting.	Then we'll begin today's meeting.
岡田と申します。	My name is Okada.	My name is Okada.
よろしくお願い致します。	Nice to meet you all.	I'm looking forward to seeing you.
今日は第1回目の会議ですので、まずは簡単にそれぞれの自己紹介をしましょう。	Since this is our first meeting, let's begin with a quick introduction around the table.	Today is the first meeting, so let's introduce ourselves easily.
その後、私から今回のプロジェクトの概要を簡単にお話しします。	Then, I am going to give you a brief introduction of our new project.	Then I'll give you a brief summary of this project.
私はこのプロジェクト期間チームを主導させて頂きます。	I am going to be leading this team for the duration of this project.	I will direct my team for this project.
普段は営業1課におります。	I normally work at unit one in the Sales Department.	I'm usually in sales section 1.
何かございましたら、1課のデスクにおりますのでお越しください。	Please come and talk to me at my desk in unit one, if you have any questions or suggestions.	If anything happens, I'll be at the first section desk, so please come.
よろしくお願い致します。	It's nice meeting you all today.	I'm looking forward to seeing you.
次に岸田さん、自己紹介をお願いできますか？	Would you like to introduce yourself next, Ms. Kishida?	May I introduce myself, Owada-san?
はい。	Sure.	Yes.
皆さんはじめまして、岸田です。	Nice to meet you all, I'm Kishida.	It's a pleasure to meet you all. I'm Owada.
普段は営業2課におります。	I am at unit two in the Sales Department.	I'm usually in sales section two.

お二人と共に働けることが楽しみです。	I look forward to collaborating with you both.	I'm looking forward to working with you two.
それではこの新プロジェクトの概要について話します。	We are now going to talk about the outline of this project.	Let's talk about the summary of this new project.
今回の新プロジェクトの狙いは我が社の新決済システムの新規利用先の開拓です。	The new project aims to identify new users for our payment settlement system.	The aim of this new project is to pioneer our new financial system.
さらに、想定できる利用先とは異なる新しい利用者も獲得することが狙いです。	Furthermore, we are also looking at extending our services to new types of users from our list of sales leads.	In addition, the goal is to acquire new users that are different from possible sources.
新しい利用者というと？	What exactly do you mean by new type of users?	What do you mean by a new user?
良いご質問ですね、通常の小売店や飲食店だけではなくその他にもということです。	Good question, it means we are aiming to attract not only retail shops or restaurants but also any other potential opportunities.	That's a good question, isn't it? Not just regular retailers and restaurants, but also others.
なるほど。	I see.	I see.
そうですか。	Ok.	Is that so?
様々な利用先を獲得したいということですね。	We want to get various type of users.	That means you want to get various applications.
その通りです。	That's right.	That's right.
だからそれぞれ違う営業部署や担当からプロジェクトチームが構成されたんですね。	That's why our team comprises different sales departments and divisions.	That's why each project team was formed from a different sales department or department.
その通りです。	Exactly.	That's right.
各部署や各課での営業スタイルは違うと思いますが、それが強みになります。	Each department or unit has a different marketing strategy, and that would be our strength.	I think the sales style in different departments and departments is different, but it's an asset.
そうですね。	Yes.	That's right.
是非、このプロジェクトを成功させましょう。	Let's make this project a success.	I'd love to make this project a success.
はい、一緒に頑張りましょう！	Yes, let's try our best!	Yes, we'll do our best together!
もちろん数値目標があるのですが、その点については次回詳しく説明します。	Of course we will have a revenue target, but we will go into that more in our next meeting.	Of course, I have a numerical goal, but I'll explain it in detail next time.
とりあえず、今日は時間があまりないので終わります。	Anyway, we should close the meeting here as we are running out of time.	Anyway, I don't have much time today, so I'm done.
次回の会議スケジュールと資料を後程Eメールでお送りします。	I'll email you the schedule for the next meeting and the supplemental documents later.	I'll send you the next meeting schedule and material in an e-mail later.
はい、承知致しました。	Yes, noted.	Yes, sir.
はい、お願い致します。	Yes, please.	Yes, please.
カナさん、ちょっとお聞きしていいですか？	Hi Kana, can I ask you something?	Can I ask you something, Miss Cana?
うん。	Sure.	Yeah.
日本に船便で身の回り品を送りたいと言っている学生さんがいるんです。	There is a student who wants to send his personal belongings to Japan by sea.	There are students who say they want to send personal goods by sea to Japan.
来月出国予定で、昨日事務所に質問に来ました。	He's leaving the country next month, and he came to the office yesterday asking for advice.	I was leaving the country next month and came to my office yesterday to ask questions.
普段荷物を送るのにはY社を使っていると思うんですが、今朝電話で見積もりをお願いしたら1000ポンド以上かかると言われたんです。	I understand that we usually use Company Y for the shipment, but when I called them this morning to get a quote, they basically told me it would cost more than 1000 pounds.	I think I'm using company Y to send my luggage, but I was told it would take over 1,000 pounds if I asked for an estimate on the phone this morning.
学生さんの予算をかなりオーバーしているので、他のやり方がないか探しているんですよね。	Since that is way out of his budget, I am trying to find other ways of doing it.	I'm looking for other ways to do it, since I'm pretty overstepping the student's budget, isn't it?
なるほど。	Right.	I see.
Y社は手続きを一つのパッケージプランでやってくれるから便利なんだけど、その分ちょっと割高になりがちなんだよね。	Company Y offers the service as one whole package, and while it is very convenient, it tends to be a bit overpriced.	Company Y does the procedure on a package plan, so it's convenient to do it, but it's a little more expensive after that, isn't it?
もし自分たちで国内の船会社と、日本で通関業者と運送会社をそれぞれ見つけられれば合計の費用は安く済むはず。	If we can find a shipping company here, and a custom broker and a delivery company in Japan separately by ourselves the total fee should be cheaper.	If we were able to find a domestic shipping company and a shipping company in Japan, the total cost would be reduced.
なるほど。	I see.	I see.
何年か前に同じような案件があったよ。	We had a similar case a few years ago.	There were similar cases years ago.
確かここに記録があったような、ちょっと待ってね。	I think I can find the record here, give me a sec.	It's like there's a record here. Wait a minute.
ありがとうございます。	Thanks.	Thank you.
あった。	Here it is.	There it is.
貨物の引き取りと日本の港への送付はW社にお願いして、税関業務はE社にお願いして、そしたら輸送もE社が手配してくれているね。	We asked Company W to collect the cargo and ship to the Japanese Port in Tokyo, then for the custom paperwork we asked Company E and they arranged the delivery for us as well.	Ask W to pick up the cargo and send it to Japan's port, ask E to do customs work, and then E will arrange transportation too.
費用は全部で500ポンド。	The total fee was 500 pounds.	The total cost is 500 pounds.
もちろん、費用の部分は貨物のサイズや重量と、あと内容物の価値によって変わってくる。	Obviously, the fee will change depending on the size and the weight of the cargo as well as the value of the contents.	Of course, the cost varies according to the size and weight of the cargo and the value of the contents later.
この時には関税はかからないですんだから良かった。	We could avoid getting any custom charge for this case, so that was good.	It's good that customs won't come at this time.
その学生さんはどのぐらいの量送ろうと思ってるのかな？	How much stuff is he going to send?	How much do you think that student will send?
この方と同じぐらいの量のはずです。	It should be about the same as hers.	It should be as much as this guy.
オッケー、まあもちろん全く同じ金額になるとは限らないけど、今回も前回と同じように進めていいと思う。	Ok, well obviously we shouldn't expect it to be exactly the same, but I'd say we can do it in the same way this time.	Okay, well, of course, it doesn't have to be exactly the same amount, but I think this time we can proceed the same way as last time.
そうですね、W社に電話します。	Yeah, I will call Company W.	Well, I'll call the W company.
荷物のだいたいの量と内容の価値を聞かれると思うから、学生さんに先に確認した方がいいかもね。	They would need a rough amount of the package and a value of the contents so maybe check with the student first.	I think you'll be asked the value of the amount and content of the package, so maybe you should check with your students first.
あっ、そうですね。	Ah, yes.	Oh, I see.
メールします。	I will email him.	I'll text you.
そうだ、W社はもしかしたらCMSを導入したかもしれないから、聞いておいた方がいいよ。	Oh, also Company W may have introduced CMS so check that with them too.	Well, the W company might have introduced CMS, so you should ask.
CMSって何ですか？	What is CMS?	What's CMS?
「コンテナー・マネジメント・サーチャージ」っていうんだけど。	"It's ""container management surcharge""."	"It's called ""A container management Sachage."""
実際ちゃんとした費用なのかはわからない部分もあるんだけど、船会社によっては港で荷下ろしするときに通関業者に請求する所があるみたいなんだよね。	It is a little unclear if that is really a thing, but some shipping companies charge the broker when they unload the cargos at the port.	In fact, I don't know if it's a reasonable cost, but it seems that some ship companies will charge their contractors when they take off at the port, right?
手数料みたいなものかな。	It's like a handling fee.	It's like a commission.
なるほど。	I see.	I see.
前回W社からは請求されなかったから、今回も同じだといいんだけど。	Company W did not charge us the last time so hopefully it still is the case.	I wasn't billed by W last time, so I hope it's the same this time.
そうですね。	Yeah.	That's right.
前の時のファイルを送っていただいてもいいですか？	Can I ask you to send me the file of the previous case?	May I send you a file from the previous time?
目を通したいです。	I want to go through it.	I want to see through.
もちろん。	Of course.	Of course.
というか、匿名にして共有のデータベースにあげておくね。	Actually, I am going to make it anonymous and upload it on our shared database.	In other words, I'll keep it anonymously on a shared database.
これからも同じような案件が出てくるかもしれないし。	We may have similar cases in the future.	The same case may come up again.
ありがとうございます！	Thank you!	Thank you!
どういたしまして。	You're welcome.	You're welcome.
プレゼンのお手伝いをしてくださるそうで、ありがとうございます。	Thanks for offering to help me with my presentation.	Thank you very much for helping me with my presentation.
私は今回のように大勢の前でプレゼンしたことがないんですよ。	I've never given a presentation in front of such big audience before.	I've never presented before so many people like this.
お手伝いできて嬉しいです！	I'm glad I could help!	I'm glad I could help!
どんなプレゼンにするつもりですか？	What are you planning?	What kind of presentation are you going to present?
スライドショーをしようかと考えています。	I'm thinking about using a slide show.	I'm thinking of doing a slide show.
我が社の購買層を示すのには円グラフが良いですよね。	I'll probably include a pie chart showing our demographic.	A circle graph is good to show our purchasing company's sales rate, isn't it?
そして地域別の販売高を示すのに棒グラフを使おうと思います。	Then I'll use a bar graph to show our numbers for each region.	And I'm going to use a bar graph to show local sales rates.
グラフはただ見せるより説明した方が良いですよ。	I would suggest explaining the graph rather than just showing.	It's better to explain the graph than just show it.
それぞれの座標軸がなにを意味するのか忘れずに指し示してくださいね。	Be sure to point out what each axis means.	Please remember to point out what each coordinate axis means.
そうすれば、あなたが説明したいことを皆さんが確実に理解してくれます。	That way, you can make sure everyone understands what you're trying to show.	Then you will certainly understand what you want to explain.
それから、グラフの各領域の色を目立つようにすること。	Also, make sure the colors between the sections of the graph stand out easily.	Then make sure the colors in each area of the graph stand out.
でも、あまり派手すぎないように。	Don't make it too fancy, though.	But don't be too flashy.
ごくシンプルにした方が良いですよ。	It's better to keep it pretty simple.	You had better make it very simple.
はい！	Okay!	Yes!
分かりました。	That makes sense.	Okay.
この題目はどうでしょうか？	How does this theme look?	What about this subject?
これはちょっと複雑すぎますね。	That one is a bit too complicated.	This is a little too complicated, isn't it?
表示の内容が読みにくいです。	It's hard to read what the labels say.	The contents of the display are difficult to read.
代わりにこうしてみたら良いと思います。	I think you should try this one instead.	I think we should try it instead.
ありがとうございます。	Thanks.	Thank you.
プレゼン自体についてなにか秘訣はありますか？	Do you have any tips for the actual presentation?	What's the secret to the presentation itself?
事前に何度か練習することでしょうか。	I would say practice a few times before.	Do I have to practice several times in advance?
前日に練習してストレスを感じるより、何日か余裕を持って練習したほうが良いですよ。	Space out your practice between a few days, so you won't be too stressed by practicing on the last day.	It's better to practice for a few days than to feel stressed after practice the day before.
ナーバスになりすぎず、ホワイトボードを見ずに会場を見渡すようにすること。	Just don't be too nervous, and make sure to look around the room rather than at the white board.	It's important not to be too nervous, but to be able to look across the hall without looking at the whiteboard.
プレゼンを暗記すればするほど、簡単に皆さんと目線を合わせられるようになりますよ。	The more you have your presentation memorized, the easier it will be to make eye contact with people.	The more you memorize the presentation, the easier it will be to see with you.
ちゃんと練習します。	I'll be sure to practice.	I'll practice properly.
その点を一番心配しているんです。	That's the part I'm most worried about.	That's what I'm most worried about.
ご協力ありがとうございました。	Thank you for your help!	Thank you for your help.
どういたしまして。	No problem.	You're welcome.
上手く行きますように！	Good luck!	Good luck!
